 This page has one sentence about the basic definition of the word, and a huge amount about the slang/profane uses. Perhaps the former should be extended; is there no information about female dogs available beyond their name? This is an encyclopaedia, not a dictionary.  

  
 i feel that whoever is looking this definition up is very appropiate and should be deleted from wikipedia...IMMEDIATLY. this word is used very often and is also a very """"mean"""" word. i belive that is majorly true. very much so. okay so, the good meaning is a female dog.  BITCH !!!!!!!!!It also stands for the name Brittany Fellows—Preceding unsigned comment added by   •    

 ==etymology== 
 The word bitch is from the Old Norse Bikkjuna meaning """"female of the dog"""" of unknown origin, Grimm derives the Old Norse words from Lapp Pittja, But OED notes that """"the converse is equally possible."""" 
 The adj. Bitchy was first seen in 1925.  
 The verb meaning to complain in 1930. 
 Slang Bitchen """"good"""" is attested to the 1950's 

 == reclaiming the word bitch == 
 The word bitch is actually only offencive in American and Canadian English. In most other English variants bitch maintains it's correct definition - female canine. People have argued that bitch is different because it is used as an insult - but so is """"pig"""", """"dog"""", """"cow"""" and others. These are not considered profane, so why is bitch? As far as I am concerned, there is nothing to """"reclaim"""" as bitch simply means a female canine. 

 It may be used as a pejorative or descriptor - that does not make it a profanity. 

    
 It should definately say something about Kyle Vanderweilen and all his bitchin Is there any particular evidence of women """"reclaiming"""" the word bitch in the 90s? Can anyone point to articles on this, etc.? The song is definitely interesting and belongs here, but doesn't actually reclaim the word """"bitch"""" any more than it reclaims the word """"sinner."""" 

 Also, I don't really understand the last paragraph and it sucks  I was going to try and clear it up, but I realized I don't know what it means. Can someone point to a source that lays out the argument about bitches, fertility and patriarchy more clearly? 

 

 :We don't need articles at all as I there are definitely enough examples (even outside of the 90s). Missy Elliot cleary and repeatedly reclaims the word, for instance, """"She's a Bitch"""".   

 ::References are fine  just the name """"Missy Elliot"""" got me to find a quote of a rolling stone review that mentioned """"reclaiming"""" the word. In fact, if some one knows more about her, it might be interesting to add a section on her work and on how it relates to women/slurs more generally within hip-hop.   

 :::How relevant is this reclamation? It seems to me poison for a woman to use an epithet which still strongly connotes despised traits. I don't see how using a word connoting """"querolous"""", """"spiteful"""", and """"malicious"""" can be empowering. But I don't know; life's a bitch.   

 ::::It stems from a reaction to the prevalence of tagging any woman who doesn't adhere to a certain standard of femininity as a bitch. To use a literary example, in the novel The Handmaid's Tale the narrator related the feeling that, whenever she outsmarted a man, she could almost hear him calling her a bitch in his mind, even her own husband. -   

 :::::That literary reaction you recited is jealousy; men have names for other men who outsmart them too, but, not having a word like """"bitch"""" for them, they have to resort to a greater variety of pejoritive epithets. Though you haven't been specific, I think that standard of femininity you referred to is a pretext for subordination, which both sexes often strive to impose on the other, but men have traditionally had more power. Because it is such a popular epithet in slang, the connotations of """"bitch"""" are diffuse, though still commonly pernicious. I think bitch, in itself, is not chiefly a denunciation to punish women who do not conform to that standard, but rather a contemptuous word often used for it.

 You wrote: 

 You will need to cite reliable sources for the assertions """"far too large to be chemical"""" and """"no endothermic storage events"""". I do not think any source can conclusively estabish either point . . . 

 It is very easy to establish both points, and there are hundreds of papers with proof of them. 

 1. The limits of chemical storage (electron bonds) are well understood. The most energy dense chemicals, such as gasoline, store 4 to 8 eV per atom. Cold fusion reactions have often produced far more than this, ranging from ~100 to ~100,000 eV per atom of the material in the cell, and in all cases there is no chemical fuel before the reaction, and no chemical ash after it finishes. Cell with a few grams of inert material in them have produced hundreds of megajoules of heat  as much as several kilograms of gasoline. if you were to burn the cell contents, they would produce only a tiny fraction of the heat. In fact, you could burn the cell, the table, and all books in the room and still get that much chemical energy. Therefore, chemistry is ruled out. 

 2. Any calorimeter can measure an endothermic event as accurately as it measures an exothermic event. For example, all calorimeters used in these studies show the endothermic formation of Pd-D at the beginning of the experiment. Since the calorimeters shows the exothermic excess heat, they would also show the endothermic storage that proceeds it. They have never done this. The heat balance is always zero before the heat bursts, and after.

 I'm trying not to just be a whinger and a hand waver here, but it annoys me that there's an entire section devoted to left vs. right politics in the US, yet there's nothing similar regarding the rest of the world. The US bias of wikipedia is very irritating sometimes, though it shouldn't be, as most Internet users are in the U.S. In other words, i'm a whiny European who is too lazy to write a non US section. 

 From the US>  That's easy to fix.  Start writing more about non-US views on topics, creating topics, and  getting your friends to help.  Something that is created by users being called biased only reflects the predominant users posting and thus can easily be remedied. 

 Also from the US> No, it's NOT so easy to fix. Throughout Wikipedia you will see entries from (obviously) American authors who have no concept of a world view and automatically write from a US perspective without any attempt to qualify their language. What, therefore, tends to happen is that the US view becomes a default with international views living in ghetto-ized paragraphs.     

 Also from the US> That is actually kind of the problem with Wikipedia all around in the first place, and that is that popular ideas are not necessarily correct.

 I actually think that the article, in fact the whole political movement, needs a better definition of """"left-right"""". Most political parties cannot adhere to a single category, including revolutionnary movements and far-right groups, as described somewhere else in the discussion. 

 I suggest a new use of the """"left-right"""" compass. 

 The political compass uses the """"square"""" system with two axis  x and y (social and économic), which is not very accurate because I know my political ideas, and they tend to be pretty nearer to Mussolini than to Gandhi. Whatever. 

 What I suggest is a cube! 

 3 axis  x, y and z 

 Économic 
 Social 
 Politic 

 The first one defines the market system (if any) of a political group. 
 The second defines the social standing of a political group about the welfare of the people (welfare checks/charity, private/public school/medical system, etc) 
 The thirds one is, basically, the way a society treats it's people (rehabilitation/punishment, democracy/totaliratism (in which I include Soviet Communism!) etc)

 ::I am not asking that the article itself draw any conclusions, and the rest of your remarks are exactly the kind of synthesis that I desire. My remarks are meant to move us past the conflict on the talk page. Our sources are, of course, the verifiable secondary sources, and we are not to do original research. As CTSWynekan has said, Wikipedia is a tertiary source. Frankly, it's enough for me that the various Christian views are presented fairly and accurately, the various Jewish views are presented fairly and accurately, the various historical views (whether by specialists or nonspecialists) are presented fairly and accurately, and all other views are presented fairly and accurately. All should be given the appropriate weight and context. That is enough of a synthesis for me.  
 ::But, we all have our subjective views, and many of our views have clashed, hence we have been bogged down in one paragraph for far too long. What bothers me is the binary thinking evidenced by some (many, not all), which has polarized the debate. We should also, of course, be sure not to confuse our various subjective viewpoints with the objective actual, verifiable and factual (as someone once said). So in the end, I essentially agree with you. My remarks on thesis-antithesis-synthesis and the rest have to do with the debate on this page, not with the article itself. I want us to move past conflict so we can examine the verifiable sources, and put aside our own views while still making sure that we (any """"we"""") are accurately represented, as are the views of others. To paraphrase Ross Perot, everybody stop fighting and get to work! If you'll check you'll notice that I've done very little work on the article itself; most of my efforts have been focused on the talk page. 
 ::NPOV (when we reach it) will be a synthesis accurately reporting the views of all, and referenced to the appropriate verifiable sources.That said, I have been as frustrated as anyone else and needed to vent my spleen (which perhaps presented my POV more strongly than I have in the past. Does that make it trinary?). My spleen has been vented. My comments will remain on my user page at least until we formulate a second paragraph that does exactly as you say, and is accepted by all. It may go back if we run into further unresolved conflict.

 • 	 Change of the Freedom Writers 

 The  Holocaust  

 The holocaust occurred during World War II when Adolf Hitler was the dictator of Germany. The holocaust is basically when millions of Jews were murdered during WWII and were intensely discriminated by Hitler and the Nazi’s. However many of the Jews had resided in parts of Europe and many of them were residing in Germany but many of them were once again murdered by the Germans because Hitler plotted on disappearing all the Jews that were in the country.  This reminds me of how Ms. Gruwell from freedom writers encouraged her students to learn and investigate about the Holocaust because not all of them knew about it or even believed it even happened and she wanted them to have confidence and knowledge about it that way they can become intelligent with the history of the event. But some people never believed that the holocaust existed and others actually did.  

 Therefore, a network of over 40,000 facilities in Germany and occupied territory and was used to concentrate, hold and kill Jews and other victims. In addition after the beginning of WWII, the Nazi’s began ordering Jews to live in certain areas of the cities in where many of them weren't allowed to leave at all. Also many of the Jews were held prisoners and had to be forced out of their residing locations and follow the orders of the Nazis or they will have to face death, but the Jews faced death anyways and about 5 million children were also killed during the holocaust due to Hitler’s orders. Also the first victims of the holocaust were homosexuals and people with disabilities and these victims were one of the first to be murdered during the event and there were also approximately more than 5 million non-Jewish victims living in Germany during WWII and as we said before the majority of them had to evacuate their places and relocate different areas. In addition there were different kinds of camps such as ghettos, concentration camps and even extermination camps where all the Jews were sent and were never free from any of the camps, and the majority of all Jews had to suffer being trapped in these places where they would be tortured and harmed intensely and later on face death due to their residence in the country where they weren't respected and treated kindly by the Germans and especially Hitler. Also the Jews were the scapegoats of Germany collapsing after WWI meaning that the Nazi’s blame the Jews for the damage that has occurred to the country and Germany wanted to gain more power in order for them to become a more powerful strong country. 

 Anne Frank Diary 

 Anne Frank was a young girl that wrote every detail in a diary in her life of the Holocaust. She was sending a message to everyone or to whom that finds the diary. I believe that she had a messenger, to tell her what was going on outside. Anne Frank was born in June 12, 1929, in Frankfurt, Germany. She was born as a Jew, and bringing a Jew was a very bad thing in the 1920’s because it was during World War I. She was hiding because herself and her family didn't want to get killed so the hide for a while in a tiny place. I don’t understand why would they do this to this poor girl and her family, that didn't do anything wrong? Why hurt the Jews? What did they do to get killed? 

 Change of the Freedom Writers 

 Should It’s amazing how the Toast of Change of the Freedom Writers has succeeded. From a group of students who didn't care about school and becoming someone important in life, to becoming someone better in life and helping other freshman students to do the same. Most of the Freedom Writes shared the same story. They didn't care about school; they only care about surviving another day in Long Beach without getting killed. Most of the Freedom Writes are teachers now in the area of Long Beach. Many of them graduated from colleges, others are part of the Freedom Writers Foundation. They should be the perfect example of success to most teenagers in High School. The reason why, is because it was then when it all started. From failing, ditching class, gang violence, poverty, and other domestic violence at home, to SUCCESS. For the most part, most of them are doing very well. They are teachers, professors and other important positions someone can have. They are living the toast of change.

 == Sleeper (Woody Allen film) == 

 In view of its creator and star, Woody Allen, the movie Sleeper is satire of trends of the 1970s placed in a futuristic setting. I'm giving as an anachronism a reference to a historical event (the abandonment of clerical celibacy by the Roman Catholic Church) in which a character finds a 1990 newspaper that refers to the """"wife of the Pope"""" having children. Such would not happen for at least 24 years after the time suggested in the newspaper.   

 Nobody says that this movie is orthodox science fiction (note that tobacco and junk food have been found wholesome and organic foods have been found harmful in an Orwellian world), but a reference to a 1990 event that is shown to be impossible because a prediction of an institutional change that does not happen for a significant time later becomes an anachronism after 1991.

 == Thanks == 

 Hi Pburka. You don't know me but I just wanted to say thank you for this comment you made at AN/EW regarding 155blue's edit warring report against me (for edits on my own talk page). Believe it or not, she also reported my supposed edit warring at the vandalism noticeboard, which of course was quickly dumped. She has apparently been educated several times about what vandalism is, but she continues to falsely accuse (and report) other editors of it. And she ignored me when I educated her about WP:3RR and WP:NOT3RR. I see that she also issued you a bogus warning just above this thread (without a signature, yet again). She doesn't know the difference between WP:PROD and WP:AFD, which doesn't surprise me because she warned me about moving a """"warning"""" - on my own talk page, no less - that was actually a template. The most concerning issue, though, is that she only has 300 or so edits - most of them in the past four months - and has shown a pattern of of rashly issuing warnings to, and filing reports at various noticeboards about, editors. Even very experienced ones, like yourself. This pattern of hers seems to indicate that she prefers to go straight to noticeboards instead of having proper discussions with editors first, even though some of the editors are vastly more experienced than her and the allegations are flawed. Anyway, just wanted to say thanks for the very on-point comment you made.   """,0

Second, you've been here only a short while, and NACs of AFDs are controvsial enough when it is a highly experienced editor (the policy actually discourages it, but doesn't ban it).  While it might seem obvious that it was going to be kept, experience will show that often an AFD will have a dozen keeps and no deletes, then after a CheckUser gets involved, we find those were all the same person, for instance.  This stuff really happens.  Even in cases where the votes are all legitimate, it doesn't hurt to wait, and of course, when there are issues such as vote stacking or any controversy, no non-admin should close.  Admin aren't smarter than non-admin, but we are expected to take the heat and are accountable for dealing with problems like this.

"A few questions that need resolving regarding this article 

 1) Why the inclusion of the actions of individuals? Surely the point of corporate behaviour is that it is the action of a corporation in itself, although these actions may not always be the intended ourcome of any individuals involved. Furthermore whilst the effects of corporate behaviour on individuals may be a useful sociological side effect I do not see this as central to the issue of corporate behaviour. 

 2) I think an explicit division needs to be made between business/capitalist corporations and noncapitalist corporations (NGOs, charities etc) as I think the proposed rules of corporate behaviour can only be seen to apply to capitalist corporations. 

 If no-one disagrees with this would people like me to attempt these changes (removal of references to indiviudals, creation of distinction between business and non-business coporations)?

In Florida, a jury is able to recommended a life sentence instead of death.

 Is there a Florida law that could counter the verdict (guilty, not guilty) if it is found that the jurors did not follow the jury instructions? On Nancy Grace there was mention of """"jury fraud""""; the only example given was that if it was proven that their decision was based on what the bible says is right/wrong. Jennifer Ford clearly didn't understand that this was the """"guilt phase"""" and not the """"penalty phase""""; furthermore, there were plenty of other degree-options surrounding the murder charge that would not have inflicted the death penalty for which she couldn't live with.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by     

 :With all due respect to Nancy Grace, there isn't a chance in H*** that will happen.  The law of Double Jeopardy will prevent her of ever being criminally tried to these offences again.  She could be sued in civil court for wrongful death for money (like OJ was) but her parents seem to be delighted that she was found not guilty so I doubt that would happen.

"::::Da si probao pročitati moje promjene vidio bi da sam neke stvari promjenio, i da stalno mijenjam neke formulacije. U zadnjem povratu si mi i izbrisao link na rezultate općinskih izbora iz 1990! Da li ti uopće čitaš te promjene? U cijeloj diskusiji mi nisi dao niti jedan jedini argument da moje promjene ne stoje. Po čemu sam ja odbacio sud u Hagu? Po čemu i jedna moja promjena niječe bilo što izrečeno na Haškom sudu? Za Blaškićevu presudu nisam nigdje rekao(ajde pročitaj još jedamput moje riječi!) da nije bilo zločina u Ahmićima, niti sam na nijedan način uopće spomenuo ulogu RH u cijelom sukobu. Rekao sam da se držiš izjava iz Haga bez da ih dokazuješ. Bilo je žalbi u kojima su prijašnje osude odbačene. Npr. Kupreškići. Ali sve od toga je totalno ne bitno za moje promjene! Ima 5 stvari koje uporno briseš(po 555put) 
 1) HDZ je pobjedio u većini općina koje je htio uključiti u HB (imaš rezultat izbora na linku) 
 2) za odcjepljenje i organiziranje nove vlasti je krivio neučinkovist vlasti u Sarajevu. U čemu je problem? Koja nova vlast (pogotovo ako je pučistička) ne krivi staru za sve probleme??? 
 3) HB je proglašena republikom za vrijeme Ženevskih pregovora u kojima se raspravljalo o podjeli BiH na 3 etničke republike. Plan Owen-Stoltenberg? Zar bi svaki pojedini pojam morao imati neki link? (a i linkovi koje sam ti dostavio očito nisu prekorisni jer kada si me tražio rezultate izbora, kasnije si tako i tako izbrisao rečenicu i rekao da rezultatiuopće nisu bitni (zašto si me onda tražio izvore???)) 
 4)priče o početku rata. Rat se rasplamsao nakon što je Travnički kanton dodijeljen Hrvatima i HVO pokušao očistiti A BiH iz njega, tj sukobi oko zajedničkih vojnih snaga (wance-owenow plan) 
 5)oko upotrebe simbola i novca. Na sve te simbole Hrvati su imali pravo kao konstruktivni narod, a što se novca tiče, glavna valuta je tijekom rata bila njemačka marka. Siljenje učenika drugih naroda da se pridržavaju hrvatskog kurikuluma je protuustavno, ali nisam imao vremena da to pravilno formuliram. 
 Nijedna od ovih stvari nije išla na štetu niti bosanske vlasti niti u opravdavanje HBa. Sve stvari opisuju stanje kakvo je bilo na području HBa, od naseljavanja izbjeglica pa na dalje. Jedina stvar koja bi eventualno mogla biti sporna je dio o 'hrvatskom strahu' ali to također još nema ispravnu formulaciju. Svaka promjena je u skladu s NPOV wikipedinom politikom, a ne vidim zašto bi za svaku od ovih stvari morao postojati konkretan link! Minimalno 10 puta sam te pozvao da mi pomogneš oko formulacije svake od navedenih stvari umjesto da ih samo obrišeš! O kakvom doljevanju ulja na vatru govoriš? Ajde daj pročitaj još jedanput NPOV politiku [], da li u njoj piše da smiješ citirati tuđe mišljenje, bez da se slažeš s njime???  Dio sa generalizacijom hrvatskog mišljenja je možda moja greška, ali nikako ne uspjevam naći ispravnu formulaciju za situaciju u kojoj 80-90% biračkog tijela bira pripadnike jedne stranke čije je službeno mišljenje takvo i takvo! Prepucavanje i flip-flop oko neke stranice ne vodi apsolutno ničemu, a pogotovo ne koristi wikipedije. Mislim, koja ti je stvar vraćati sve na staro usprkos svakom dokazu? Na samom početku diskusije si me tražio izvore za rezultate izbora 1990, ja ti ih pošaljem, a ti svejedno izbrišeš rečenicu za koju si tražio potkrijepu?? Ajde molim te probaj malo to pročitati i razmisliti o svemu rečenomu. Niti jedna od mojih namjera nije bila loša niti služi za nametanje tuđeg mišljenja, niti opravdanju HBa(milijunti put!) već proširenju konteksta. I ne shvaćam zašto pričaš o izjavama iz bosanskih medija, niti kako bi nešto bilo drugačije da navedeš, makar kao izvor neku od tih izjava. Koja je razlika između rečenice 'the Herzeg-Bosnian leadership is presently awaiting trial at the ICTY on charges including Crimes Against Humanity' i navođenja konkretne optužbe za zločin? Svaki zločin bez obzira na nacionalnost treba biti kažnjen. Zar su crvena krvna zrnaca nekog zato što je jedne nacionalnosti imuna na ratne zločine??

 I mentioned it on my message that you left, and think we should put it on the DISCUSSION page for anyone else to chime in on.

 ==Randall Flagg== 
 Take out the picture of King instead. A picture of the character seems more relevant than his creator, especially seeing that as of now, there are two images of him from the books, two from TV, one of King, and none from the comics.    

 :My image qualm doesn't stop with Palpatine and Jabba. Those are older FAs that were established before the rigorous overhaul of fair use images in articles. Per the actual criteria, you need to have something about the image beyond simple identification (the only exclusion to that is the infobox image). My fear with the article in FAC is that criticism will arise about how influential this character is King's novels, yet how slim the article is on information about him. If you feel it is ready, then go for it. The worst that can happen is that it is not promoted, in which case you will most likely have a lot more eyes telling you what you can do to improve it, thus making it that much better. There is no draw back to not getting promoted other than not getting that little bronze star. D

(See this last edit ) The editor was blocked for breaking 3RR. The person posted a reason on the talk page for the content blanking. But their reason just seems to say it was OK for them to delete the referenced text because another user said it was OK to do so. To me it just looks like an anti-Jimmy Page opinion edit and not an edit to help improve the page. Could you look? I think the edit should be reverted. But the other day I noticed similar content removal and odd section altering so I reverted the back back to a version by Y2Kcrazyjoker as that appeared to be the last version that was stable. But I look today and see my edit was reverted by this tagged account and the edit summary claims my edit was some sort of sockpuppet edit. You can read the edit summary. To me it is very unclear. If you feel that person is up to something and revert his blanking I would be curious as to what names he chooses to call you? If I find a good Chuck Berry book in my travels I will post you.

 :::Well, Permyakia and Perm Oblast have established economic ties and a lot of common infrastructure—that's one of the main reasons.  Also, Permyakia is heavily dotational, relying on the federal transfers to form a significant portion of its budget.  Problem is, federal government is not always good with transferring funds timely, which, as you imagine, creates all sorts of issues.  Perm Oblast, on the other hand, is a donor, and once both budgets are merged, it will ease the pain somewhat (but note that during 2006 there will still be two separate budgets, so there will be a transitional period).  Another thing—Permyakia will still have a special status within new Perm Krai.  The main scoop is that Permyakia will no longer need to rely on federal government's transfers (but will, of course, become dependent of Perm Krai's budget), and Perm Oblast will gain access to Permyakia's resources.  The merger also lowers administrative costs—instead of two local governments there will only be one.  Considering that Russians and Komi-Permyaks co-existed peacefully for quite some time, there is something in this merger for both parties. 
 :::In 2003, a poll of 309 people was conducted among the population of both oblast and autonomous district.

USAID and the EU PHARE project provided counterbalancing advice which took into account the voucher system that had been instituted in Estonia, which was alien to Schmidt's German experience.  Indeed, in opposing the first public offerings for shares, in the manner of Margaret Thatcher's government in Britain, Schmidt commented that such methods equated to the reintroduction of communism.  When majority stakes were sold in former state enterprises according to the classic German method, especially to entities associated with the state enterprises' managers, questions were asked as to whether the majority shareholders were unduly profiting by not treating their part-subsidiaries at arm's length.

"""== Update == 
 Tell Tyrone to check his messages. A representative of the Wikimedia Foundation has made an attempt to contact Stephen Colbert through his staff. In the meantime, I'm still gathering more information about the specific linking issue.   (Lee)  
 :That's an edit summary in an admin's block log, not a message sent to anyone in any official capacity  contrary to popular opinion, some Wikipedians do have a sense of humor. The message that was sent to him would represent an attempt to ascertain identity following an established procedure. If Colbert wants to promote his site here, all he needs to do is make a trivial effort to establish his identity to the Foundation, which is already seeking to contact him as we speak. Not that I have anything to do with this, but I thought I might alert you to a simple way around this.   (Lee)  

 :Sheeh. I apologize for not being more clear. I didn't exactly expect you to go searching through miscellaneous site logs when I mentioned that someone from the Foundation was attempting to contact Colbert. The Wikimedia Fountation is, just to clear, the non-profit organization that handles Wikipedia's business and legal affairs. They're seeking to contact him, actually, over events related to the previous night's """"Wikiality"""" discussion on the Report  this is something I heard through the grapevine and not anything I know much about  but I thought perhaps that if this site is indeed a scrappy little underdog of a marketing campaign for book whick Colbert considers his baby, he or a representative might want to bother to have a fifteen minute discussion which would allow tek-related information to happily coexist with Wikipedia's policies. He doesn't have to do anything he doesn't want to, but since the folks at the tekjansen site seem to be somewhat preoccupied with the status of a single link here  and have us listed as their top referrer, despite the link being down half the time  I thought the option might be of interest. No, huh?   (Lee)  

 :Re-read the above. I did not say they had to falsify the list in order for Wikipedia to be the top referrer. I suggested a brief phone conversation might be worth the trouble if we're generating the bulk of their traffic and they're looking to promote. Take a deep breath. 
 :I also did not say Colbert has to verify his identity in any way. However, since the site seems to fail several points of our linking policy, yes, the site is likely to be removed without additional information being provided. I'm sorry, but the """"it's relevant anyway"""" angle is fairly weak; the only reason this material would be an especially relevant resource on Colert would be if it was actually Colbert's writing. It does not have information on anything relevant to Stephen's biography. Generally speaking, we don't count fan forums as an invaluable, unique resource  see WP:EL.  That leaves the book, which, while possibly being Colbert's, is irrelevant if it's not. I could write a novel about Charlene and post in on my website, and that would also not be relevant. Or a novel about Stephen Colbert for that matter. In any case, I'm sorry that for some reason I seem to have pissed you off. I have no idea why you're so angry about this, but I assure you again, as I have assured you before, it's nothing personal.   (Lee)  

 My AMA request, which you seem to have found, was a private request for advice on how to handle a situation which has become somewhat tense. You are welcome to conduct a straw poll if you want  I haven't followed through on that personally because I've already have openly solicited comments from editors at the Colbert talk page, and believe we already have a pretty good index of what most experienced editors think of the link. But go for it. As I have stated before, if there's a consensus to add the link, I won't remove it. I never, never, ever, not even once said that I will """"refused to allow the link unless [myself] or a Wikipedia """"official"""" is contacted by someone at the Colbert Report"""" so please stop misrepresenting my remarks.

 As well as traditional timekeeping, Apple Watch will allow wearers to make contactless payments with Apple Pay, a mobile payment service introduced at the same event as the Watch. The Apple Watch is capable of receiving phone calls as well as iMessage and SMS Texts. It can track fitness, run third-party apps built using WatchKit, Apple's new API for Apple Watch software development, control the Apple TV, as well as act as a walkie-talkie and a viewfinder and remote shutter-release for an iPhone camera. 

 ===Design=== 
 Apple Watch will be available in a number of customisable design configurations, across three distinct 'collections', in two sizes (38 mm and 42 mm), making 34 individual models. Considering the number of physical models, and the wide variety of digital watch faces available on each model, the potential to personalise Apple Watch is considerable. Apple's head of design Jony Ive stated in an interview after Apple Watch was announced that the total possible number of unique designs is 'in the millions', although it is as yet unclear whether this is an exaggeration. 

 Apple Watch also features a new, pressure-sensitive touchscreen that can distinguish between a tap and a press, and features a dial called a digital crown, which can be turned to scroll or zoom and pressed to return to the home screen, allowing the user to interact with content on the display without obscuring it with their fingers. It also features a 'Taptic Engine'; a linear actuator which provides haptic feedback to users when they interact with the watch, or when they receive notifications, as well as allowing them to share physical 'taps' with other Apple Watch users. 

 The watch is charged by means of inductive charging, using a cable similar to the MagSafe cable for Apple's MacBook family of laptops. Reports also suggest that the retail box for the 'Edition' series of the Apple Watch will act as a combined charging and display stand.",0

"Ring mail, mail, plate mail. 

 Hello 
 There is indeed several type of mail and again in different countries ended up calling them a different way. 

 All the historical mail I have seen is 1 in 4 or 1 in 6, oriental style as in Japanese and Moghul/ Mongolian, this done with flat or round rings. 

 Now if I say 1 in 4 to you how do you know if I am refencing the “European” 1 in 4 or kagomegata-gusari  futae-gusari, kame-ko-gusari (or the Indian equivalent) 

 Oriental mail organises the ring differently. The rings are flat on the fabric and they are linked but much smaller oval rings. There are several patterns. Regardless it is very different in construction from “European” mail. 
 My understanding, and I can be wrong, is that the Victorian used the tern ring mail to describe the European mail in opposition to the oriental way, which was called chain mail. 
 To be fair, it has good as anything yes the even the flat rings when mounted looks like a succession of rings and the oriental mounting look like a chain.  

 If you take some Moguls, Mongol and Islamic armour, some of them have the same oriental disposition and link small plate of metal. Those plates are separated by and attached to strip of mail.

"""The whole concept of blocking and banning is an anachronistic tribal practice that not only predates the advent of the Rule of Law, it's the very subject of the first three laws ever carved onto stone tablets, some 3750 years ago... 

  
 Hammurabi of Mesopotamia 

 These are the first three laws, in their entirety, of the Code of Hammurabi, translated into English: 

 :1. If any one ensnare another, putting a ban upon him, but he can not prove it, then he that ensnared him shall be put to death. 

 :2. If any one bring an accusation against a man, and the accused go to the river and leap into the river, if he sink in the river his accuser shall take possession of his house. But if the river prove that the accused is not guilty, and he escape unhurt, then he who had brought the accusation shall be put to death, while he who leaped into the river shall take possession of the house that had belonged to his accuser.  

 :3. If any one bring an accusation of any crime before the elders, and does not prove what he has charged, he shall, if it be a capital offense charged, be put to death.  

 The second law seems bizarre by modern standards. It appears to be the source of the dismissive phrase, """"Go jump in the lake.""""  (Compare to the Yiddish expression, Nem zich a vaneh! """"Go take a bath!  Go jump in the lake!"""") 

 There are 282 such laws in the Code of Hammurabi, each no more than a sentence or two.  The 282 laws are bracketed by a pukeworthy Prologue in which Hammurabi introduces himself, and a narcissistic Epilogue in which he affirms his authority and sets forth his hopes and prayers for his code of laws. 

 Note that Wikipedia is not even as evolved as Hammurabi, since Wikipedia does not even do the level of due process required of Hammurabi's first law. 

 Given that Wikipedia has adopted an anachronistic pre-Hammurabic tribalistic ochlocracy that does not even rise to the level of the Code of Hammurabi, is it any wonder that Wikipedia is the venue of recurring classic liminal social drama that reprises the oldest stories in the annals of human history?   

 Hammurabi's notion was to advise everyone to go jump in the lake when they are tainted with an unproven allegation. 

 I reckon the secular cultural practice of absolution through ablution inspired the Early Morning Baptisers of Qumran to co-opt Hammurabi's Remedy into the Mikvah Ritual Bath. Baptismal sin cleansing survives to this day in most Christian denominations. 

 Of course there was that interlude in the desert where there were no bodies of holy water, so Aaron devised an alternate ritual involving a delightful goat named Caprice. I am rather fond of Caprice, since her story inspired portions of the Passion of Christ. 

 I find it ironic that a site that purports to offer the sum of all human knowledge is still struggling to learn the oldest lessons in the annals of human history. 

 So I suggest people wash their hands of Jimbo's anachronistic cult of pre-Hammurabic tribalism, cleanse themselves of the grit by jumping in the lake, and evolving to a more modern and enlightened governance model along the lines suggested by such innovative pioneers as Moses, Socrates, Buddha, Jesus, Lao Tsu, Maimonides, Thomas Becket, Stephen Langton, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, Henry David Thoreau, Mohandas Gandhi, ML King, Thich Nhat Hanh, John Rawls, Father John Dear, Barak Obama, Kermit the Frog, and Barsoom Tork Associates.

So if you perform a Lorentz transformation of points A and B, from system S (where the ships are moving with v after acceleration) to S' (where they are at rest after acceleration), you are calculating the endpoints of resting objects in S', thus you have the rest length of the objects and the distance between the endpoints. And what do the Lorentz-Trafos tell us? Well they unambiguously show that the distance between A and B (again, those are the coordinates of the endpoints of in S' resting objects) has increased as compared to the coordinate length between A and B in S. Of course, this is in perfect agreement with relativity of simultaneity, which shows that the spaceships started at different times in S', thus they had different accelerations... 
 ::::Summarizing: 1) You have two endpoints A and B with different accelerations in S', therefore they are moving away from each other in S', and after the acceleration the distance of the now resting objects has increased, and the string has been stretched. 2) Of course, one can also choose frame S in which the accelerations """"appeared"""" to be the same due to relativity of simultaneity, and therefore the increased distance in S' """"apparently"""" stays the same in S.

 == Illusions about """"standard Croatian"""" == 

 The debate on this page is purely political and as disconnected from scientific discussion as are apples and watermelons. So much ignorance and nonsense flies around that it is next to impossible to start anywhere to debunk this ignorance so strongly displayed by almost everyone. 

 Like this """"pearl"""" from a certified """"Iknoweverything"""": 

 There is no such thing as """"Slavic origins"""". Anyone making a claim that tens of thousands of year old genetic markers have anything to do a decades- or centuries-old identities, that have been constructed in the historical period as can be abundantly attested in the respective literature, is a brain-dead moron. The spread of Slavic identity was primarily through linguistic assimilation (the word Slavs originally meant """"those who speak like us""""). Croats from northern Croatia are much more genetically close to neighboring Hungarians or Austrians than they are to remote Russians. The same is valid for any other imaginary collective that we call nation-state or civilizational milieu. Ivan Štambuk (talk)  

 For your information Slaven, not Slav is the original word. And the word """"Slaven"""" means in a number of germanic languages (consult german or english dictionaries for more info) a """"dirty boy"""". Think of a prepubescent or a teenager's face and clothes after a game of football and you may get the picture. Only in your twisted and ignorant head the word """"Slav"""" means something. ANd of all things you claim that it means """"those who speak like us""""... 

 In which language? Do tell.  

 Ignorant.  

 How about tis other """"pearl"""" from local """"authority"""" on everything: 

 """"Croats from northern Croatia are much more genetically close to neighboring Hungarians or Austrians than they are to remote Russians. The same is valid for any other imaginary collective that we call nation-state or civilizational milieu."""" 

 A number of genetical studies have been conducted since the war in Jugoslavia and every single one has confirmed that 51% of Croats, especially those near Austria and Hungary are genetically Slavens (Slavs, if you prefer) and as such are identical to Russians, not to Austrians or Hungarians. Many of these studies have been conducted by Croatians too, so above """"pearl"""" is only indicative of the size of Stambuk's ignorance, already verified too many times to mention here. 

 Another genius, among many, tty29a quotes here and then misses the point completely: 

 """"    Another cold fact is that Ča- Kaj- and I-kavski are not even dialects. Rather, they are deflections of adjectives (in Ikavski, ijekavski, ekavski) and/or pronouns (in sto-sta- kaj- ca- kavski). Fundamental grammatical rules are identical and do not change beyond what could only be described as dialectal differences between Ča- Kaj Sto- Sta- I- kavski. 
     Let me see if I got this right. They're not dialects but they have dialectal differences? You seem to be in disagreement with your self. Deflections of adjectives and pronouns? Really? Also, if the grammatical systems are identical, why do they have different case and tense systems? I honestly hope you're just a troll. tty29a:talk """" 

 Have a look at this from the quote by tty29a: """"Fundamental grammatical rules are identical and do NOT change beyond what could only be described as dialectal differences between Ča- Kaj Sto- Sta- I- kavski."""" 

 And tty29a misses the NOT completely to come up with this nonsense: """"They're not dialects but they have dialectal differences? You seem to be in disagreement with your self."""" 

 The only one in disagreement with himself is tty29a. The other person who wrote the quoted text made it CLEAR that they are NOT dialects. 

 And the story goes on and on, forever and ever. Few and far inbetween with some understanding and knowledge, but for the most part just a bunch of ignorants debating things which they do not have the capacity, intellectual one, to grasp and process before they grab the microphone and start making fools of themselves. 

 As a linguist with 27 years of experience, I am apalled with the level of ignorance that reigns here. You people have no idea what you are talking about and yet you have take to yourselves to be the arbitrators who say what goes and what doesn't.  

 You are products of your consumeristic and instant gratification society. Online anarchists who believe in some higher purpose that the rest of us must absorb and abide by your decisions in order to make it happen. Linguistic cannibals.

 :: Well, may I ask both of you to refrain from personal attacks here. 
 :: In general, there is of course no rule that there must be exactly one writer or painter etc. But having a choice, I think one should try to get as large diversity as possible. It is true, that the diversity is not only in terms of occupation but also gender, time etc. I think there is currently a good coverage of different times starting with James Mayer de Rothschild, i.e. from the beginning of the 19th century. One may think of including a rabbi from an earlier age. There is a dedicated section on Rashi with a woodcut showing him, therefore I thought it is not necessary to include the same picture once again in the collage. I don't have another candidate. 
 :: My comments to the proposed persons: 
 ::* I agree with  that Michel de Montaigne and Irène Némirovsky are bad candidates for the reasons given above. The relation to Holocaust is not really established by including Némirovsky. She was murdered in the Holocaust, but there is no """"story"""" behind it on which the reader would focus. 
 ::* As for Simone Weil, she can be considered as an alternative to Mirra Alfassa, if there are good arguments why she is a better candidate. One may have one person who converted to another faith, as an explicit example. 
 ::* As for Chagall vs. Pissarro, whatever the motivation of some editor may or may not be, we should not make our choice to show this editor that he/she is right or wrong. I vote for Pissarro, for two reasons: 1) to increase the Sephardi faction, and 2) because Chagall is included in at least 4 other collages (Russian Jews, Belarussian Jews, Ashkenazy Jews and Jews). Having the same person in all collages makes the reader think that there was only one Jewish artist worth mentioning.  
 ::* As for Marcel Proust, I cannot yet judge. In my opinion, if someone comes from a mixed family, the person can be considered if a kind of Jewish identity can be seen in the biography. E.g. in the case of Pissarro, it is written about his father that """"Upon his death, his will specified that his estate be split equally between the synagogue and St. Thomas' Protestant church."""" This tells me that the father was a member of the Jewish community (while the mother was probably protestant), and this should have been reflected in the family life. Is there any sign of Jewish identity in the case of Proust? And if yes, whom can Proust replace in the collage?   """,0

":Dear Damorbel, you have a serious problem of understanding: you are more or less insensitive to overall or large-scale inferential structure in physics. Overall inferential structure is important in the presentation of physics. In times past, inferential structure was taught as part of the syllabus in dialectic and logic, but it seems that you did not attend to it, and have not developed a sensitivity to it through experience in study of physics. Important distinctions that are made in logic and dialectic are between definitions, theoretical principles, axioms or postulates, empirical observations and demonstrations, empirical generalizations, inferences, deductions, inductions, abductions, hypotheses, assertions, assumptions, conclusions, contradictions, inconsistencies, incoherences, and theorems. These all have their places in the presentation of physics, but you seem more or less unable to see how they fit together to provide overall inferential structure, apparently because you have not attended to it or do not value it. Your rhetorical questions just above seem to support this reading of the appearances. As I have mentioned before, you may not be entirely to blame for your difficulty here: some writers, including Kittel & Kroemer, and Reif, regrettably think they are very clever in trying to teach thermodynamics as a consequence of or as part of statistical mechanics. Thus Kittle & Kroemer actually entitle their text Thermal Physics; the result is that students become muddled about the overall inferential structure of the subjects, and get into the difficulties such as those that beset you.

"Of course it is more complex than that. I would suggest everyone’s identity in Ireland (and elsewhere) is a lot more complex than that. However, we agree that he was Irish (the country of his and his families birth). You strive to identify his nuanced form of Irish identity. I do not think this is helpful, as this is contentious and can not be simply asserted in the opening paragraph. 

 So, if we have to discuss his form of Irish identity (I think dealt with quite sufficiently in the subsequent section, his protestant background etc) we need to understand that 
 1. Anglo-Irishness generally refers to the wave of “new-english” colonisation which occurred after the 16th century. Clearly Wellington’s ancestry pre-dates this time frame (Online: The Anglo-Irish, Fidelma Maguire, University College Cork). Indeed, the Norman invasion brought his family to Ireland along with other families such as Burke, Fitgerald, Darcy, Joyce, Barry, Clare etc., families which cannot but be declared simply Irish. 
 2. Since the 19th century, the term Anglo-Irish has been used in a prejudicial manner to marginalize a certain section of the Irish population (Online: The Anglo-Irish, Fidelma Maguire, University College Cork). The term is consequently contentious.  
 3. Finally, even for those historical figures whose ancestry does fall into the correct time frame according to Maguire, for example Charles Stuart Parnell, Isaac Butt, John Millington Synge, Oscar Wilde, George Bernard Shaw, WB Yeats, Samuel Beckett (or was he of Huguenot!), they are clearly identified as Irish in the literature and, rather importantly in this case, Wikipedia articles. 
 I therefore see no reason why the same standards and logic should apply and why Wellington should not be included in such outstanding company. Can you?",0

 Actually, I'm pretty sure it IS possible to sail faster than the wind with a square sail set perpendicular to the true wind.  However, the vehicle must be constrained to move at some angle to the wind.  Consider an ice-boat one a downwind course 110 degrees off the wind.  With a square sail and low enough drag, the ice-boat should maintain a *downwind* vmg of nearly wind speed with this configuration.  That will give it a true speed far greater than wind speed.""",0

  in Ernst Lubitsch's comedy Ninotchka (1939)]] 
 With her last film, George Cukor's Two-Faced Woman (1941), MGM attempted to capitalize on Garbo's success as a comedienne by casting her in a romantic comedy which sought to portray her as an ordinary girl. She played a double role that featured her dancing the rumba, swimming, and skiing. The film was a critical, although not entirely a commercial, failure. Garbo referred to the film as """"my grave"""". She retired in 1941 at the age of thirty-six after only twenty-seven films made in sixteen years. She was offered many roles in the coming years and showed interest in several, but in each case, she either turned down the part or the project did not come to fruition. 

 In 1948, Garbo signed a contract for $200,000 with producer Walter Wanger, who had produced Queen Christina in 1933, to shoot a picture based on Balzac's La Duchesse de Langeais. Max Ophüls was slated to adapt and direct. Garbo made several screen tests, learned the script, and arrived in Rome in the summer of 1949 to shoot the picture. However, the financing failed to materialize and the project was abandoned. The screen tests—the last time Garbo stepped in front of a movie camera—were thought to have been lost for forty years before resurfacing in someone's garage. Parts of the screen tests were included in the 2005 TCM documentary Garbo.""",0

 Have you read the references? They are saying the exact opposite of what the quote I deleted said. The quote is either completely made up or has its meaning inverted through omission: 

 'Mr Hamazono, though, bristled at the suggestion that he and his fellow Tokkotai pilots were the forerunners of modern-day suicide bombers. 

 """"We were completely different,"""" he said. """"We did what we did for our comrades ... the terrorists kill themselves for purely selfish reasons. I don't get angry when I hear them described as the modern-day kamikaze, but it troubles me that religion, not love, inspired them to do these things.' 

 'Missions """"totally different"""" 

 Japan's originals are insulted to be mentioned in the same breath. 

 """"When I hear the comparison, I feel so sorry for my friends who died, because our mission was totally different from suicide bombers,"""" Hamazono says as he strolls through the Peace Museum for Kamikaze Pilots in Chiran, a former air base on the southern Japanese island of Kyushu. 

 The kamikazes attacked military targets. In contrast, """"the main purpose of a suicide bomber is to kill as many innocent civilians as they can,"""" Hamazono says. That, he says, """"is just murder."""" 

 The same distinction is made by other survivors of the Tokkotai, or Special Attack Force, conventionally known as the kamikaze. Its survivors tick off the reasons why their goal-line stand against an American invasion was different from the blind lashing-out of suicide bombers today: 

 • We were ready to die out of love for our country, they say. Suicide bombers are driven by hatred and revenge.'

Damn, you are good!!Actually the truth is somewhat more prosaic: my son was getting hives, we thought it was another food allergy, the allegist couldn't figure out what was going on, so he ordered some blood tests, the blood lab was on the same floor as Braverman's organization, I had never heard of him and read his article and, as is almost inevitable when I read an article, I edited it.  Period. Full stop. End of story.Now, if you had come here and simply talked about the possibility that Braverman is a quack, that he is practicing outside the boundaries of his formal education, I would be sympathetic to your views: one thing that interested me was that Braverman's waiting area  which I had to pass through to get to the blood lab  is really lavish, much more so than your typical doctor's office, which raised suspicions in my mind.

"== New categories in Education == 

 Hello - I started to revert some of your edits, but thought that before I went any further I'd engage in some discussion here, as I think there may be some way forward. I notice you created new categories: 
 *Teacher associations based in the United Kingdom 
 *Category:Standardised tests in the United Kingdom 
 However, I'm not sure if these are the best titles for these as the articles you've included in them do not really fit these categories. For example, in Teacher assoc's you have included the Graduate & Registered Teacher Programmes which are training programmes linked to various establishments, rather than associations. Similarly, you had listed QTS which is actually a qualification / status rather than association. 
 In the standardised tests cat you have included all the Key Stage articles, while these are actually periods of study, not tests of qualifications in themselves. 
 As I say, my temptation is to remove these articles from these cats, but perhaps you'd rather relabel the cats if you think it's worth keeping those articles together?    

 :Thanks for your message! I started out at Category:Charities based in the United Kingdom which was packed full and not making use of already created sub-categories. On sorting them down, a number of educational related articles appeared in many areas, including: independent schools; teacher groups; student groups; research, etc. From a practical point of view, most of the independent schools are charities, so those that had just been placed in the top category were sorted downwards into the new category Category:Educational charities based in the United Kingdom. I didn't create any new categories which didn't already have an existing country split somewhere in that created line, mainly from United States principle- ie: I just copied that structure, not creation of a new structure. Having got that down, I then moved onto Category:Organisations based in the United Kingdom. Again, a number of educational organisations appeared, which had been over categorised - again, I followed the existing country split, mainly form existing US splits. After nearly two days of sorting, I am sure I have probably miss-sorted a couple of articles, so if you think an article should sit in a different category, then please feel free to sort it across. But please don't push it back up to Category:Education in the United Kingdom - it was a mess! If you need some help, please just ask. Best Regards,",0

 == Long-term sockpuppetry violates Internet Service Porviders' """"Terms of Service"""" == 

 I have been around here long enough now to see the countless hours put into chasing sockpuppets and their dynamic IP addresses.  As you know, Internet Service Providers have strict """"Terms of Use/Service"""" agreements with their customers.  In these TOS agreements, it clearly states that if the customer uses the ISP services to damage or destroy websites, or for other harassing type of behavior on the Internet, then their service will be terminated.  So, after years of chasing some of these """"banned users"""" here on Wikipedia, I think a good case could be presented to an Internet Service Provider that one of their customers is doing great damage harassing the Wikipedia project and wasting the resources of Wikipedia.  All you would have to show is a history of damage/harassment done by the sockpuppet/dynamic IP and the exact times the IP made those edits identified as vandalism, then the ISP could trace it back to a particular customer and terminate their service.  Obviously this would only be used in extreme cases which have gone on for many months or years. I'm certain someone at Wiki must have thought of this before, so what is the problem with implementing this as policy on Wiki?   """,0

 :I am not suggesting that we should use incorrect terminology because many people use the wrong terminology. 

 :My claim is that the English language definition of the word """"royal"""" does not mean """"must be descended from god."""" I am arguing that the term royal is accurate and is entirely consistent with the Al-Sabah family, as described by you and Michael Herb. 

 :My disagreement with you is on English language definitions, not Islamic culture. 

 :Your explanations about Islamic cultural norms include the implicit assumption that the word """"royal"""" includes """"descended from god"""" as part of its definition. If, as I assert, that isn't an integral part of the definition, then it calling the Al-Sabah's the """"Kuwaiti Royal Family"""" does not go against cultural norms at all. 

 :It is also important to be aware of your audience. Wikipedia is not a place for formal academic papers. When I am writing a paper in my field, computer science, I write using the formal terminology of the field. The audience of the paper is formal academia. When I am writing for a non-academic audience, I will use different terminology. I will avoid words that we have re-defined or defined especially narrowly, since I know that those definitions are only meaningful within the appropriate context. 

 :Wikipedia is supposed to be written in standard English. Correctness and accuracy are supposed to be achieved using language that is understandable by people who are not academics in the field of the article. 

 :From what I understand of your statements, your portion of the academic community has taken the standard English language definition for the word """"royal"""" and added an additional requirement, """"descended from god."""" 

 :Think through the implications of your idea: You're going to write your text with, in your mind, certain definitions for your words. However, since your audience, while educated, is not a part of your academic field, they'll think the words you're using mean something else. You're saying that this is clearer and more accurate? That's ridiculous. Clarity and accuracy come from the reader and writer using the same definitions for words. 

 :Your more formal and more accurate word re-definitions are, I'm sure, useful and valuable when you are discussing this topic within academic circles. Wikipedia is not one of those circles. 

 :I hope this at least makes my position clearer. I would sincerely appreciate it if you could stop trying to portray me as somehow being anti-intellectual or anti-academia. I consider accuracy and correctness to be very important. I value academic research and input.

 Please do not use speedy delete tags on articles which clearly do not meet the criteria, like page views.   

  
 ===Response=== 
 I was not 'abusing' the speedy delete tag. At the time I added the tag, it was a plaintext (not standard WP font, don't know how it managed that) dictionary definition, was therefore not encyclopedic and therefore qualified for speedy delete.   
 *Plaintext is not a speedy criterion, and neither is dictionary definition.   
 **Not being encyclopedic is   
 ***Which of the criteria says that?   
 ****Articles #1: '# Very short articles providing little or no context (e.g., """"He is a funny man that has created Factory and the Hacienda. And, by the way, his wife is great."""").'. At the time I added the tag, the plaintext formatting (no line breaks) meant that the article was a single, incomplete sentence [the rest of it wasn't displayed]. This means that it qualified for CSD under the criterion I have linked to.   
 *****I really don't think this criterion was intended to get articles deleted merely because their contributor is unaware of wikipedia's formatting system, but I will make a note of your interpretation.   
 ****** As I have already said (I'll repeat, since it's clear from your failed RFA that you're an arch-inclusionist), the formatting was not the reason I added a speedy delete tag to this page. very short articles containing little or no context are speedy deletion candidates, regardless of the reason.

 == The harm of articles == 

 According to my logic, every article has cost, and what we're buying with that cost is maintaining or increasing article quality.  The set of books that meet our notability guidelines is huge, but still small enough that the community is willing to tolerate low-quality articles in hopes that they will be improved sooner rather than later.  If you expand the pool of potential articles to any published book, we're going to be inundated with low-quality articles, most of which won't ever be improved (not the least because, in the absence of reliable sources, we have nothing to say about them other than the fact that they exist).   

 If you want to take responsibility for all aspects of an article, from polishing the prose to making sure every WP:MOS-mandated em-dash is in the right place, and you do this before you put the article in to mainspace, then in my experience you'll be given quite a bit more leeway (especially in non-controversial areas).   

 There's one more reason the """"does no harm"""" argument is annoying.  In the time it's taken for us to have this colloquy, you could have gone out and found a few of the reviews that I found.  """"Does no harm"""" absolves you from having to improve the article.

 == Aristotle's nationality inadequately adressed == 

 After reading the article on Aristotle and reading some archival material regarding Aristotle's nationality, I have concluded that no one (including moderators) have sufficiently answered this issue: Was Aristotle Greek or Macedonian? Moderators tend to simply shut down other individuals arguments one way or another, but make no sufficient conclusion. Thus, I present to you some of the information which should be adressed in order to pursue a more accurate conclusion of Aristotle's origin. 

 According to the Penguin Books Classics publisher's historical biography of Aristotle in several of their (current) published Aristotle texts, Aristotle is designated as being Macedonian - not Greek - due to the (supposed) facts that: 1. he never spoke Greek since the current form of the Greek language was undeveloped. Rather, he spoke a tribal language of Vlach origin 2. While some simplistic historic accounts render ancient Macedonia as a Greek city-state, more accurate accounts reveal that Macedonia was considered by the Greeks to be a barbaric savage-land 3. Aristotle was chased out of Athens due to his Macedonian origins by an anti-Macedonian mob. This forced Aristotle to live out the remainder of his life in exile. 4. Macedonians were originally of Vlach, Trachi and Illiri (in addition to 4 or 5 other tribes, I cannot recall the names) tribe origins. In later centuries, slavic people began moving to Macedonia, however, there still exists a genetic connection between many contemporary Macedonians and the original 7 or 8 tribes. Aristotle supposedly had Vlach and Illiri descendants, accounting for the fact that he spoke a non-Greek language. 

 Keep in mind, that these are not my assertions, but rather, the assertions of a reliable publisher and source, Penguin Books. And if any moderators attempt to claim that this source is """"unreliable"""", I should like to remind them that Wikipedia has yet to have earned the recognition of being reliable. I would find it hard to believe that any adequately educated individual would not recognize the unreliability of Wikipedia. High schools and universities alike have restricted students from using Wikipedia due to its """"butchering of the nuance-related or obscure facts."""" 
 Perhaps, if Wikipedia staff members and writers strived to be more accurate in their articles (and I certainly hope that they do), Wikipedia would be well on its way to scholarly recognition.""",0

 :Hi. Well, in my opinion USA has both Force and Justice on their side in this case. By """"Justice"""" I don't mean human legal system. I mean Justice, as one of the highest principles (I have to mention this because it seems I wasn't quite clear about that in the previous post, so you misunderstood it).  I have to admit I don't quite see what you're trying to do with mentioning again UN Charter and other documents. I've already said - those are lists of UN wishes. It's not a law per se, and thus it is not convenient to use the word """"guarantee"""". UN is in no position to guarantee anything. UN can use a Force just like any single nation, but what they do is not """"legal"""", and I already explained that in the previous post. UN works on a mob principle, similar to democracy. If you have Force strong enough to impose something, and a will behind that Force, then you do it. If not, you don't. My parallels with French revolution are very much relevant, and I would still like to hear your answer: do you support French revolution and democracy or not, even though such a thing was """"illegal"""" then as much as Kosovo is illegal today? Also, do you consider USA an 'illegal' state, considering that their independence was illegal? And one more thing regarding legality - do you consider invasion of Iraq legal, and if not, what is UN doing in punishing the countries who invaded Iraq? If UN cannot or does not want to punish countries that invaded Iraq, your whole point of """"UN law"""" or """"International law"""" goes down the drain, instantly. One of the requirements of """"law"""" is having a Force strong enough to impose it, and to make sure everyone obeys it. If there is no Force sufficient to ensure adherence to the law, then there is no law - it's a list of good wishes. One can then say that independence of Kosovo is against the wishes of some, but that hardly has any relevance at all when those whose wishes are for the independence are stronger. Back to your post. I agree with you that UN was made to protect stability and peace, and that's why I don't like UN. If UN was there to manifest Justice, I would support it. As it is, I don't respect UN, and I think not respecting UN is a good thing (you made it sound like it's a bad thing). To answer your question: not every minorities want independence, and those minorities who want it should get it. That's right, if Istria in my country wanted independence I'd be among the first to vote in their favor. I have entirely different concept when it comes to self-determination of minorities. I reject the idea of national state, I think it's a flawed concept which was historically useful as much as democracy was historically useful and as mush as the tyranny of Peisistratos was useful. It's not a concept that's in itself good, but it's a concept which helped bring a civilization to the next level. I wanted to make explanation a bit longer but this section of Wikipedia doesn't allow it so I won't bother. To sum it up: I think a country should be run so well, that no one in their right mind would even want to break-off. And if someone does want to break-off for whatever reason, an economic (and other) alliance should be made to neutralize bad side effects of having too many small countries (a concept similiar to USA or EU). Oh, and regarding the last part of your msg - I repeat, there is no such thing as 'relevant international law'. Also, """"whether the law is enforced or not, that's another story"""" is a very strange figure of speech, since a law that is not enforced is not a law at all. It's a list of good wishes.   """,0

"""Previous two dudes, you're obviously close-minded dogmatists of """"Rationalism"""".  You should honestly investigate claimed supernatural phenomena so you don't live bad lives and end up in Hell.  You're the irrational one by insisting without proper investigation that such phenomena is automatically bogus.  And shame on the next dude for just parroting a false and malicious conclusion.  You show forth your stupidity in the most abberant manner.  I am a real scientist and I have examined what evidence is available to me regarding claims about Therese Neumann.  She was a Saint and her phenomena proof of the truth of Catholicism, which she herself indicates by her manner of life.  She's not an isolated case.  There's thousands of well-documented and reliable accounts of modern and past supernatural phenomena on the part of Catholic Saints that backs up their claims that Jesus founded the Catholic Church and that it's the only true religion. 

 Everybody with wisdom realizes Wikipedia has a heavy liberal bias and won't give us the truth on almost anything.  Giving both sides of the story here is not truth.  Therese Neumann is one of thousands of messages from God to the world that it should be Catholic. 

 And Neumann, if the yogi dude isn't lying, probably either didn't understand his words (Eastern religious jargon) or just wanted to be nice and not cause a fight.  If he wanted her opinion, in Western cultures, you ask the person straight-forward.  Hinduisms are not at all like Catholicism.  Hinduisms are more like 'I think I am one, therefore I am'.  Catholics are Catholics only if they do and say what the Church defines that Catholics do.  E.G. murderers commit a mortal sin and stop being Catholics.  And I'll be honest with you, guys like that would lie about what she said just to use her for their scheme.  It seems more in line with what honest people record her saying that she told him he'd go to Hell if he didn't become a Catholic.

You have to realize that our understanding of al Qaeda was in a pretty primitive state before 9/11, because so few took them seriously, and the ones who did, perceived them through older models of analysis (the """"state sponsored terrorism"""" thesis) that are not as relevant to a diffuse network like al-Qaeda.  People cite the fact that Richard Clarke used to think there was a link as if it proves that the link must be true.  Oddly, these are the same people who dispute Clarke's credibility now.

But don't pretend these opinions have the same weight as a bipartisan commission assigned with the specific mission to investigate these sorts of things, especially when their conclusions have the benefit of years of hindsight (as opposed to the opinions of some Clinton admin members back in 1998).  Some Clinton officials  e.g. Daniel Benjamin  investigated the al Q link with the belief that they would have found links to Saddam, and were surprised when their research proved the opposite.  I think it's silly to think that we should give greater weight to what these people said in the mid- to late-1990s than their conclusions after years of further research specifically focused on the issue.  23:17""",0

"==zoroasterian false claims== 

 It is rediculous to claim that Zoroaster proclaimed Ahura Mazda as the monothiest god of manking for the first time in history in the times of Cyrus and the father of King Darius the great around 700 BC. 
 It is more rediculous that in no time Zoroaster declared yet another unborn god Ahriman yet as another god hence Dualism. 

 It is known that the first ever writings of Zoroaster was his dream of seeing Ahuramazda the one god well known so to the iranians for time immmemorial , then declaring seeing another god like a shadow to ahura mazda in the second dream two weeks later as he writes. 

 It is well known that Zoroaster is the first man claiming another unborn god hence he is the father of dualism. he was no revealed religins-prophet like monothiestic religion (Noah, Abraham=Judaism, christianity and islam) for he declares getting his knowledge from dreams never spoke to god or a messenger of god). It is impossible to dissociate Ahoramazda from Magusis the adherants of Dualism, of whom King Darius the Great clearly declared a war on them by killing the Magusi sardis the usurpur of the kingship and declaring a yearly day celebration called (the day of the killing of the magusi Magimortis) in which he allowed his people to kill any magusi (dualism adherant) in that day even in the magusi;s own house, this is why magusis used to hide in that day in other places in that day of the year. 

 Obviously  much later after Darius the Great  that the Magusis (adherants of Zoroaster) managed to take control of the great Persian kingdum) which caused its demise , the magusis continued control of the poor persian people who hated magusis until islam freed them from those magusis and deported them back to their home land  India. 
 It is known that Magusi in semitic is same as Nagusi ( ie dirty person: a person who uses magic by invoking evil spirits by using dirty (Nagis) stuff such as wolf's tail  or putting urine in foood or drink to do favours to women for money (like a woman who wants her husband to love her again or to get pregnant etc). It is well known that the magusis were not from Persia but a low cast from India like gypsies who used to do dirty works for the Persians namely slaughter of animals) that is when they started making future predictions (fortune telling) by studying the signs on the liver of the slaughtered animals. Zoroaster was one of those Magusis who was a great Magician (do magic by dirty stuff) and proclaiming for the first time in history the ideas of Dualism in an official religion. Arabs said in their ancient writings before islam that Zoroaster so disgusted people that they gave him the nick-name Shuraik (ie who adds another god to G-d) since pagans and poly-thiests since ancient times belied that the other gods they worship were not just representations (spirits) of the one mighty god, however Zoroaster was the first to declare a shadow god to the mighty g-d hence God of light and god of darkness to explain the inequality and injustise in the world (remember they were a low cast from india avoided by people (magusis used to live away from villages just like gypsies because they were considered dirty lowly (heathen) posessed by evil spirits they get from the animals they slaughter for the persians). 
 Even the word Magic, Magician, Magi (plural of Magusi in English) come from the magusis of Persia who were not native of Iran but gypsies from India who use Magis=Nagic=Dirty stuff to do their witchcraft and favors to stressed women and men throughout history).even in our times!!

 == Sisters Upset Communion Being Turned into Political Issue == 

 Here is a statement from the website of the Sisters. 

 We can certainly now start to build this into the article.   

 Sisters Upset Communion Being Turned into Political Issue 

 """"We are dismayed that a moment of genuine communion during sacred worship is being twisted for political gain by the forces of hatred and dissension. — Sister Edith Myflesh, Current Abbess of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, Inc.  

 SAN FRANCISCO — On Sunday the 7th of October, the morning of the Castro Street Fair, two members of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence® attended Mass at Most Holy Redeemer Church. Most Holy Redeemer is located in the Castro neighborhood of San Francisco and """"prides itself in being an inclusive Catholic community."""" The service was an opportunity to welcome the new Archbishop of San Francisco, Most Rev. George Niederauer. While at Mass the Sisters joined other parishioners in respectful and sincere worship and received Communion from the Archbishop. After the services, they stayed to socialize with the congregation before moving on to attend the Castro Street Fair. 

 Sadly, while the Sisters participated in the celebration, others not there to worship secretly filmed and photographed the Mass hoping to spark a controversy and cast the parishioners of Most Holy Redeemer and the Archbishop in a negative light. These professional muckrakers then gave the photos to an anti-gay Fundamentalist Catholic Website which in turn sent them to right-wing media outlets who willfully distorted the facts for political gain. 

 The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence are appalled that some media outlets have unwittingly spread these distortions while others have intentionally taken advantage to fuel a mean-spirited and divisive political agenda. These forces have been critical of Most Holy Redeemer for their welcoming approach to the diverse community they serve and have frequently seen fit to attack the parishioners as part of a larger campaign against """"San Francisco values."""" 

 Our hearts go out to the parishioners of Most Holy Redeemer and to the Archbishop who have been unfairly stigmatized by these disingenuous campaigns for doing nothing more than following the welcoming teachings of Christ and administering Communion in keeping with the teachings of the Second Vatican Council. 

 We would like to take this opportunity to state again that, contrary to the spin of right-wing fanatics, that the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence do not """"mock nuns"""" but live """"as nuns,"""" taking vows that affirm the traditional compassionate and justice-seeking ministries of religious women, extending their reach beyond the convent walls to those most in need. We are open and supportive of all forms of spirituality that teach respect for human life, diversity, freedom and community, including those of the Catholic Church. In fact, we have given several thousand dollars in grants to several religious-based organizations, including Most Holy Redeemer. 

 It is no secret that our vows sometimes call us to challenge the dogmas and hypocrisies of the Catholic hierarchy, in the same way they call us to confront politicians and even leaders within the queer community whenever they use their power and influence to promote fear, shame, division, and self-hatred. It is a bittersweet irony that these same forces of fear and shame now use the media to twist a moment of genuine communion into another justification for policies that harm people of faith and members of the LGBTQ community. 

 In keeping with our vows to expiate stigmatic guilt and promulgate universal joy, the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence call on all people of good faith to oppose those who would desecrate the sanctity of a church and defile a moment of true communion for cheap political gain. In a world wracked by violence and fear, we have no time for such lies and will continue to serve our community by boldly proclaiming that joy is more powerful than shame. 

 We extend our sincerest gratitude and affection to the parishioners of Most Holy Redeemer and hope that their new Archbishop continues to walk with them in service to the gospel of joy and justice.""""http://www.thesisters.org/MHR_Release.html""",0

A retail site selling a toy train provides product information details about the toy because people don't buy products without information on them, but they are selling the toy train, not the information. Moreover, information products are often written by people trained in providing information; researchers, librarians, journalists.

 == Final draft… maybe == 
 This will go on the evolutionary ethics page. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_ethics, it will go after the section called """"Further reading""""  

 Evolutionary ethics struggles as a system of normative ethics, which asks the question """"what should I do?"""" It struggles due to the logical fallacy of turning a statement about what is, into one about what we ought to do (see naturalistic fallacy). As a meta-ethical theory, one that tells us the nature of moral judgments, evolutionary ethics can be used as a decent descriptor on why we have certain views on right and wrong. As a meta-ethical claim it does not tell us what is right and wrong, but rather that the origin of our ethical practices come from our evolutionary history. This tends to lead to a less black and white view on ethical beliefs and leaves much more room for gray areas.   

 Many philosophers who support this view of evolutionary meta-ethics use it to undermine Aristotelian teleology, a belief that we can't reduce things to the parts that compose them, but the end they are trying to achieve is very important. At times evolutionary ethics is used to undermine moral realism, a view that morals are objectively true and do not rely upon a person’s thoughts or attitudes. However other philosophers still use evolution to champion moral realism. Often they will argue that there is a set of moral truths and that our behavior naturally tend towards moral truths because of evolution. 

 More often however, it is used to support moral subjectivism. This is a belief that moral truths are subjective and often times based on cultural norms, thoughts, and attitudes towards a subject matter rather than a set of mind-independent truths. Evolutionary ethics assumes we have a set of basic underlying morals, such as not killing another person. This stems from the evolutionary need to allow the species to survive. Then some of the more graininess of ethics comes from the differences in cultural upbringings and backgrounds, and thus the finer points of ethics would be considered subjective.

 == Please resist the urge to spin == 

 As a gay gamer who has been playing video games since the 1976 Fairchild, I can say that I have been FAR from impressed with the representation of gay identity in video gaming. I can tolerate ridiculous stereotypical depictions of gay folk, but what is worse is the systematic censorship. Classifying mere gay identity as """"mature/sexual/adult"""" is one way of enabling retailers like Wal-Mart to de-gay their shelves and content creators to de-gay their products, citing sales concerns. It is patently discriminatory to act as if being openly gay is """"more sexual"""" than being openly hetero, yet people blithely accept this double-standard all the time. 

 While there isn't much news coverage to be found about this, the Christian Right is driving quite a bit of this. Their scare tactics routinely include trying to convince parents that gays are after their children. Having openly gay characters in video games, especially when they're not villains and fools, is a threat to their system of using us as pawns in their quest for power. 

 The Sims proved people wrong who declared """"only hetero males play video games"""". Besides, it's a self-fulfilling prophecy to make products designed to appeal to the taste of one demographic and proclaim that others simply have no interest in gaming in the first place. It's quite convenient. How much of this dearth of gay content (and I don't mean token content) is due to the fact that most developers are heterosexual men? 

 So, please resist the urge to spin the history of gays-in-gaming as being much rosier than it is. Even The Sims titles censor us, making us """"convert"""" people into homosexuals (a very offensive thing to force a gay person to do, let me tell you) and force characters into romantic interactions. A token non-foolish non-evil gay character here and there does not equate to an industry in which people like myself truly feel there are products that are non-narrow. And, frankly, the phrase """"the pink dollar"""" itself is rather offensive. The money I earn is green. When I touch it it doesn't transform due to """"the gay"""". Historically-minded folks may also want to remember that pink was the color for boys and blue was the color for girls in the 19th century. I would hope that developers will start seeing an end to heterosexism and homophobia as being more about creative freedom than cash.""",0

 == Taxobox removal == 

 I removed the taxobox. The article seems to be about a common name that refers to most (or all) species of two cetacean families.   

 :This was reverted here, with the edit summary Revert - information in infobox takes this into account, provides useful information. Dolphin is a common name for some species of the two families, not a single scientific taxon. The article explains this fact, I would not remove """"useful information"""". The specious inclusion is very misleading, it is best explained in the article. What reliable source would state it refers to these two taxa, when some of them have the common name of whale? Why should the taxobox be used for an article about a non systematic name?   

 ::I wouldn't  have a problem with having two families in the taxobox, except that under current taxonomy this one is now incorrect.  I am not concerned about the fact that some dolphins have a common name of """"whale"""", since most authoritative sources would recognize those species dolphin species despite the common name, since all are in Delphinidae.  But the problem is that the River Dolphins have now been split into multiple families, so just using """"Delphinidae and Platanistoidea"""" is no longer correct.  And rather than include five families in the taxobox, which becomes somewhat spurious, it seems better to remove the taxobox and discuss the taxonomy in the article.    

 :::What if the family section is just left out? Or be given a note like """"See article""""? I like the infobox and it does provide useful data and a basic glance at where dolphins fit in in the animal kingdom (it never fails to amaze me how many people do not seem to realise dolphins are mammals!). Looking at some other articles, there's no consensus on the infobox usage. The whale article has no infobox for example, while many others such as the shark, lizard or turtle articles do have them.    

 ::I have a problem with original research being used in our document. This would include basing a taxon on a common name, there is no concordance between common names and biological nomenclature. A reader comes here to acquire facts, those few who do not know they are mammals can gain that information from the content proper of the article. The two families, or even five, are not given an accepted taxon; the fact that some reliable sources (also!) name some of the species as Dolphins is incidental, not authoritative. Everyone likes the taxobox, let us be careful with our names here most of all, it is not an infobox. I appreciate that the undue weight given to other names appended to the correct name may cause this misapprehension, but the consensus is that a taxobox should summarise a single taxon and be included in only one article. Whale is without one for reasons that are intimately linked with this article's title. The other examples you have given are [hopefully] given in RS that state, unequivocally, a common name refers to a taxon: """"Sharks (superorder Selachimorpha)""""; """"Lizards (Suborder: Lacertilia) are a very large and widespread group of reptiles of the order Squamata"""" [highly debatable, but still a single taxon]; and superorder Chelonia (turtles) is yet another reptilian (Sauropsida) example that needed resolving. Removing duplicated or specious (spurious) taxoboxes is never popular with those who had a notion to include them, I'm not sure why, but it is certain to be the right path for clarifying explanations to our dear readers. An article on the common name 'dolphin' is justified, it could be more than a dab, but it is not a taxon. Please undo the unfounded revert of my edit.   

 :::All dolphins belong to the suborder of Odontoceti, every animal mentioned in this article does, so the taxobox """"tree"""" is correct (especially considering my last edit) - so no incorrect data is given in the box.

 """"When it comes to the propagame America's Army, the next quotation is striking: 
 """"The initial success of America's Army has exceeded the Army's expectations, and Colonel Wardynski and his design team are excited about the possibilities. """"We're going to be pushing out new versions of the game as fast as we can build them,"""" he says. """"This same team will be building missions, weapons, and new features for years to come."""" The nation's youth can expect a lot more from their friendly army of one.""""( 'America's Army' Targets Youth by Jacob Hodes & Emma Ruby Sachs)"""" 

 """" From the analysis of the advergame and the striking resemblance I have described with the propagame America's Army I will now turn my attention to the consequences for communication on Internet by such games."""" 

 """" The exception is America's Army because it communicates itself as a company in which citizens can join. The aim is to let the gamers themselves join the company as an employee and be the producers within of the message the army sends. One of the aims of advergames is to construct a process of viral marketing, but this is done unlike the propagame. The advergame aims that consumers virally communicate about the game or the message it beholds for the purpose of spreading the word, but not to become one with the company itself. DaimlerChrysler for example wouldn't make a game in which one is being trained to become the director of a car factory (this would create competition). Not yet (emphasised), but maybe in the future it will when one seeks for employees."""" 

 """"I thus called it a propagame: a game that propagandises a message to become the message. Within the game, gamers are disciplined and the power structures are like the common army power structure: top down hierarchical.""""

I don't think you are saying that pedophilia should not be defined as a sexual preference (as a primary sexual interest). That goes against your arguments for it being defined as a sexual preference. You have often made the distinction between it (a preference) and child molestation (the act). So are you saying that a person cannot be primarily sexualy interested in adults and prepubescent children? If so, this article is not saying that either. Or are you saying that the """"exclusive"""" part is not needed, because """"primary"""" takes care of it? My thing with """"primary"""" taking care of it is that it makes it sound as though pedophiles often have some other sexual object choice (pubescents or post-pubescents). I don't always relate the """"non-exclusive"""" offender to a """"primary"""" offender, though it can mean that. I take """"primary"""" to mean a pedophile who often sexually focuses on prepubescent children and can get a little sexually aroused by pubescents or post-pubescents. I take """"exclusive"""" to mean pedophiles who have no chance whatsoever of becoming sexually aroused by pubescents or post-pubescents.

 :The ideal ratio is zero - that is, zero first-party references, at least for things that relate to claims of notability.  For academics, it's not always going to happen, but get as close as you can, even if it means greatly reducing the scope and size of the article.  Basically, barring """"gotta have it"""" things like year of birth and year of death, if it's not important enough that someone else has written about it, then it's not important enough to put in Wikipedia.  The article on Nobel-prizewinning immunologist Rolf M. Zinkernagel is on the short end of acceptable for a Nobel-prize-winner but it would be about the right size for a scientist whose contributions to mankind were somewhat less significant.  Notice that, while it actually needs more references, the things that need to be referenced in all but the last paragraph are almost certainly written about in independent, secondary sources.  ///(e-mail) """,0

"""Information about the stink prank product Liquid ASS should be added to the article about stink bombs.  The article mentions another product, Fart Spray, by name and alludes to another product (fart bombs).   

 I added information to the article regarding Liquid ASS along with a link to the site (see Liquid ASS).  However, the administrator deleted it.  He explained that the outside link did not meet Wikipedia external links guidelines (which I had read beforehand).  In my opinion, an external link to Liquid ASS falls within the guidelines since the Liquid ASS web site contains information on use (see Liquid ASS Suggested Uses) and testimonials from users (see Liquid ASS Testimonials).  I checked the """"Links to be Avoided"""" and found no criteria there that would cause me to think an external link to Liquid ASS would be inappropriate.   

 No explanation was given for removing the two sentences altogether that I added about Liquid ASS, which are as follows: 

 Another stink prank product, Liquid ASS , comes in a small bottle and is applied to objects with a fine stream by squeezing the bottle.  Since Liquid ASS does not use sulfur, it has a genuine smell of feces and road-kill. 

 I also find it interesting that the method of applying Liquid ASS is the same as that as used by Who Me.  Does Liquid ASS smell as bad, also (or worse)?  Sounds like a good assignment for the administrator since this topic apparently falls within his area of expertise.

""":To address the points one by one: 
 :* The Palmer quote was originally just """"filthy animal poison""""; this was criticized for being out of context so more context was added and it's now a longer quote. Apparently this is not the context that was desired, so what exactly is meant by the criticism that the Palmer quote is """"out of context""""? 
 :* I don't see why the Palmer quote is """"gratuitous"""". It provides motivation for chiropractic's early strong opposition to vaccination. We can't expect the casual reader to be familiar with this motivation. 
 :* I was originally opposed to putting the Kansas data in on the grounds that it wasn't published in a refereed journal, but Fyslee liked it on the grounds that it is a reliable source. Fyslee talked me into it so I put it in. I disagree that the Kansas data is """"cherry-picking""""; it's the most recent survey we have and its results are not hugely different from other surveys. However, it does appear to be two editors to one right now, so for now I removed it. We can revisit this issue if Fyslee chimes in again. 
 :* While it's true that statistics can be manipulated, these statistics (except for the Kansas data) are taken from reliable reviews, not from primary sources. When reliable reviews are reporting numbers, I don't see why the Wikipedia article should settle for vaguer statements. 
 :* As mentioned above the article could use reorganization, but that's a big project; for now many chiropractors do argue against the effectiveness of vaccines (unlike most other skeptics, who focus on safety) so this is the most plausible location for the material now. 
 :* Mentioning other CAM professions would be welcome, obviously supported by a reliable source. I suggest the Ernst 2001 source mentioned above.

 == What is and isn't a tribe? == 

 I think this article needs to better describe what a tribe actually means, and in particular what sorts of groups or societies are or are not tribes.  It also needs to better explain what the objections to using the word """"tribe"""" are.  I have a dictionary that defines the word tribe, but gives a caveat on the usage that:  
 :''In historical contexts the word tribe is broadly accepted ( ‘the area was inhabited by Slavic tribes’), but in contemporary contexts it is problematic when used to refer to a community living within a traditional society. It is strongly associated with past attitudes of white colonialists towards so-called primitive or uncivilized peoples living in remote undeveloped places. For this reason it is generally preferable to use alternative terms such as community or people. 
 However, I've also seen people object to the use of """"tribe"""" do describe such ancient societies, claiming """"they weren't tribes, they were kingdoms"""" (this was in reference to Germanic rather than Slavic tribes I think - I don't know if that makes any difference).  In summary, I'm unclear of the meaning of the word if """"tribe"""", and the objections to it are because: 
 :a) It is a meaningful word, but not considered """"politically correct"""" due to association with colonialist attitudes 
 :b) It is a meaningful word, but often gets misused to describe things that are not tribes 
 :c) It has no consistent meaning, and doesn't tell you anything useful about groups so described

I have no issue with leaving the """"Austrian/Ron Paul type"""" label that Krugman uses to criticize Schiff, but Krugman is making a generalization here that leaves the reader no other interpretation than to accept Krugman's premise and conclusion. Because A, ergo B. If we use just the label """"economist"""" for Krugman and do not identify the branch of theory that he identifies with, it would give undue weight to his criticism of Schiff and his Austrian economic leanings because the lead for the Schiff article does not describe Schiff as a trained economist whereas Krugman is a professional economist writer. So to use the earlier analogy, if Krugman's view of the Austrian school can be boiled down to Because A, ergo B, then Austrians may view the Krugman premise as Because A, ergo C. In otherwords, Krugman says Austrians are wrong and Austrians view their position as correct. Hence, if we accept the disparaging context of Krugman's label and reproduce it verbatim in the Schiff article, it must be prefaced giving context to Krugman's self described leanings. To allay 's concern that Krugman does not consider himself a Keynesian, I performed a google search for """"krugman keynesian"""" and looking at several of the top five results would strongly imply that Krugman holds a Keynesian worldview. Here a couple that I was able to glean: I April 25, 2012 - The Big Wrong - """"And now the results are in: Keynesians have been completely right, Austerians utterly wrong — at vast human cost.""""  II April 25, 2012 - WHY AREN’T WE ALL KEYNESIANS YET? - """" I have often wondered why Keynes - unlike, say, Freud - has never become a pop cultural icon."""" I will reiterate this point again; since the Schiff article identifies John Maynard Keynes as an opponent of Schiff's, and since Krugman seems to identify with Keynes, ergo prefacing Krugman's criticism of Schiff and all the """"Austrian/Ron Paul types"""" by using the label """"Keynesian economist"""" is both descriptive and balanced. I see no evidence in wikipedia or wikitionary to show keynesian as a generally accepted derisive term; I can see that it may be derisive among those who hold an opposing economic view either as an adherrent to an opposing school or informally by not accepting Keynesian implications on government policies.

 EU: around 2 million 
 rest of america including canada): abou 2.5 million 
 Asia: about 2 milllion 
 rest of charting countries+sales through years= 1-1.5 million 
 total= 17.5-18 million copies worldwide since 1990 
 with almost the same way of thinking anyone can agree that her sales are about: 

 Mariah Carey: 17.5-18 million 

 Emotions:14.5-15 million (or something like that) 

 Mtv unplugged: about 15 million (approximately)(other sales figures4this album could b 13-14m.)

 either provide a citation to support the text in the article, or kindly remove the text. as this is presumably a matter that has received non-trivial attention in the last 2 decades in the US, a citation ought not be difficult to find, if in fact the information given is correct.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by     

 I back this. This concept seems very, very controversial, and I've personally never encountered it. It needs to either be cited, and properly contextualised as outré, or removed.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by     

 ==legal fiction== 
 Concerning """"a legal fiction""""; were I the original author, I might choose to open the article with a tone less aggressive and more informative to the layperson. """"Legal fiction"""" is a term of art.  I don't believe it should be the """"definitional headline."""" It is; however, accurate.  Restatement (Second) of Torts §283 comment c (1965) (""""The reasonable man is a fictitious person, who is never negligent, and whose conduct is always up to standard."""")  In Vaughan v Menlove (1837) 132 ER 490 the """"legal fiction"""" is implied. First, when the jury was instructed that the defendant was required to have acted as a """"prudent man"""" would have acted under those circumstances.  And then under review, the directive was deemed too vague.  Further, it was determined that a defendant acting honstly and bona fide to the best of his own judgement would afford no rule at all and leave open infinitely variable individual judgement. Nuance aside, the foundation for the """"legal fiction"""" for the basis of comparison exists. The """"reasonable person"""" is a fact assumed or created by courts.    

 To eliminate the """"citation needed"""" might I suggest: 
 * Bedder v Director of Public Prosecutions [1954] 1 WLR 1119 (where """"reasonable man"""" is deemed a wholly impersonal fiction to which no special characteristic of the accused should be attributed) 
 * Camplin [1978] A.C. 705 (a reasonable man """"means an ordinary person of either sex, not exceptionally excitable or pugnacious, but possessed of such powers of self control as everyone is entitled to expect that his fellow citizens will exercise in society as it is today"""") 
 * R v Smith (2000) 4 AER 289 (citing Champlin and Bedder: a preasonable man """"is a person having the power of self-control to be expected of an ordinary person of the sex and age of the accused, but in other respects sharing such of the accused's characteristics as they think would affect the gravity of the provocation to him; and that the question is not merely whether such a person would in like circumstances be provoked to lose his self-control but also whether he would react to the provocation as the accused did"""") 
 That said, I maintain that a citation is of modest benefit if not entirely unnecessary. From conceptual inception, the question has never been """"is the 'reasonable person' fictional?"""" I submit the question has always been, 'Is a reasonable person defined in accordance with a particular normative ethical commitment or in accordance with an empirically observed practice or perception?' I posit that a reasonable person, possessed of minimal education, should have little difficulty exploring the nature of """"legal fiction"""" (given the link) were they so inclined.

I hope to see them ALL included in a section that is relevant such as maybe Responses to criticisms of feminism or whatever.  I cut them because they are completely irrelevant to the section as titled, because in some cases they completely buried the few short criticism statements themselves and because it is important to fully develop the criticisms, by themselves, before counter-criticising them if we are to understand these critisms at all. 
 
 I did add one little statement of (child abuse/parental abuse) content to one criticism because I happened, by coincidence, to have done the research for another article but I am not a member of that group, nor do I back that criticism as mine...I just saw it was relevant to that criticism and it may well need to be cut too unless THEY use it to back THEIR claims. 

 Finally, I tried to cleanup some tortured paragraphs by separating separate topics into new paragraphs, making it clear who was criticising in each PP and asking for specifics where I was confused as I read the content. 

 Again I hope to see the full scope of all criticisms and counter-criticisms included in this article with distint, complete and clear arguments.  This cleanup is in NO WAY meant to imply that any of these counter-arguments themselves were wrong or irrelevant...just that they do not belong in this section which is for the arguments against feminism themselves.

 == Ebony article? == 

 Does anyone have a citation to the 1990 Ebony article mentioned on this page?  A search of issues since 1989 (in an online database) turns up nothing that matches this description, and no 1990 articles that come at all close.  The reference was added by user Antares33712 at 20:19, 29 December 2005.  It's possible that my search results were incomplete, but it's also possible that the author misremembered the publication or the article details. 

 Because the current page accuses Ebony of printing misinformation (regarding Mariah Carey's race) and also suggests that the magazine article made other questionable claims, any mistake (either an inaccurate paraphrasing of an actual Ebony article, or a misattribution of someone else's article to Ebony) could be considered harmful to the magazine, and conceivably libellous.  I'm insufficiently familiar with Wikipedia's standards to take the step of removing it myself (I just added a """"fact"""" tag), but I wanted to call particular attention to the question in case others deem this the sort of thing that requires expedited action.  And of course, if someone does have a citation to add, or can correct any mistakes without deleting the entire reference, that would certainly be preferable!

The issue is with it calling these ideas Buddhist without any sources to back up the claim that they are Buddhist ideas - and within a framework of non Buddhist concepts.  

 ::: It would be good to have a proper informed discussion of karma and comparison of the different ways it is understood in different traditions and problems with it. But this isn't it.  

 ::: Indeed if you check the sources given for many of the comments here - they come from a series of articles whose authors - as best I can tell (they are rather technical theological articles) - are looking at the possiblity of applying the Eastern idea of karma to give an explanation of why a just and good God can permit a world with evil and suffering in it. The article I read didn't claim to be an overview of Eastern ideas of karma - but rather an application of them to theology. That's why it is imbued throughout with ideas from Western theology that do not fit well with Eastern ideas. 

 ::: So - if this material is included -it needs to be made clear where it comes from and what the discussion is - and given its proper context, and because the sources are articles by Western Christian theologians - at least the ones I followed up - that is another reason why it belongs in the Western section.

"== French overtures to Japan, 1883-5 == 
 Hi , 

 Thanks for that interesting stuff you have dug out on French attempts to cosy up to Japan against China before and during the Sino-French War.  I'm going to search Albert Billot's L'affaire du Tonkin, the standard French diplomatic history of the Sino-French War, to see if he can add anything to your research. 

 What I would like to do eventually is merge your new section into the existing section 'China's fear of Japan', and probably cut it down a bit.  At the end of the day, France and Japan did not become allies, and I think it unbalances the main article to devote so much space to something that never happened.  On the other hand, I've long been wanting to create a new article, Diplomacy of the Sino-French War, and that would be the natural home for a discussion of French overtures to Japan.  I'll try to get round to it before long. 

 I'll get back to you after I've seen what Billot has to say on the subject. 

    

 P.S.  Nice photo you uploaded of French soldiers in Tonkin in 1888. 

 P.P.S Can you spare a couple of minutes to do me another 'dioceses' template, 'Dioceses of the Syrian Orthodox Church'?  Just change the title from the present 'Dioceses of the Church of the East template and scrap the illustrations, and I'll do the rest.  I know how to edit existing templates but I haven't yet worked out how to create new ones.",0

 The implication here is that the USADA sanction needs to be """"ratified"""" by the UCI.  That's incorrect.  There is no source for this, and I suggest because no source for that exists.  The sanction is in effect immediately, as is indicated by Armstrong's inability to participate in officially sanctioned triathlons.  The UCI needs to ratify nothing.

 The """"bull"""" in """"bullshit"""" is unrelated the """"bull"""" meaning """"a ludicrous jest."""" It is, as suggested, a portmanteau of """"bull"""" (n.1 in the OED) """"the male of any bovine animal"""", and """"shit."""" 

 According to the OED, the """"ludicrous jest"""" version (n.4) is is not derived from Papal Bull: 

 """"No foundation appears for the guess that the word originated in ‘a contemptuous allusion to papal edicts’, nor for the assertion of the ‘British Apollo’ (No. 22. 1708) that ‘it became a Proverb from the repeated Blunders of one Obadiah Bull, a Lawyer of London, who liv'd in the Reign of K. Henry the Seventh’."""" 

 I'm sorry, but I don't know how to cite the OED, as I have the electronic version.    

  

 Oh wait, I take that back. This is how they have in the OED: 

 [f. bull n.1 + shit n.]  

 1.1 Rubbish, nonsense; = bull n.4 3. 

 First they have it in the n.1 sense, then in the n.4 sense just below, so I'm not sure.

""" 

 On Sunday, March 11, the Washington Post published profiles written by Scott Wilson of two Israeli professors: Ilan Pappe and Benny Morris. The profile of Pappe, """"A Shared History, A Different Conclusion,"""" did not provide key context about why he is so reviled in Israel. 

 Ilan Pappe, a history lecturer at the University of Haifa, freely admits that, in his view, facts are irrelevant when it comes to the history of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. """"Indeed the struggle is about ideology, not about facts, Who knows what facts are? We try to convince as many people as we can that our interpretation of the facts is the correct one, and we do it because of ideological reasons, not because we are truthseekers,"""" Pappe said in an interview with the French newspaper Le Soir, Nov. 29, 1999. 

 Elsewhere, Pappe elaborated on his attitude toward historical investigation and academic objectivity: """"Historical Narratives . . . when written by historians involved deeply in the subject matter they write about, such as in the case of Israeli historians who write about the Palestine conflict, is motivated also...by a wish to make a point"""" (History News Network, April 5, 2004.) A more complete collection of Pappe's statements repudiating the value of historical facts is available here. 

 In light of Pappe's openness about his contemptuous view of scholarship, and his rejection of historical facts in favor of ideology, it is negligent that Scott Wilson's profile of him omits this key context. The piece portrayed the Haifa historian as a """"revisionist scholar"""" who languishes in """"nearly complete isolation"""" in Israel supposedly due to his alleged myth-busting research and political views, in which he opposes the existence of a Jewish state, even within its 1948 boundaries. For example, Wilson quotes without challenge Pappe's absurd allegation that """"My research debunked all of the lessons about Israel's creation that I had been raised on.""""   """,0
"== Zahara == 

 The article says Zahara was born in 2011. The source for that contains no such information. This is important because Russell's mother said in trial testimony (punishment phase) that after the child was born, Katherine spent nearly 10 months at the family house, with Tsarnaev visiting mainly on the weekends. If this is true, it means that Russell was not present when the FBI interviewed Tsarnaev, and was likely not present in September 2011, when the Waltham murders happened; which of course reduces her potential culpability. If anybody has a direct source giving the date of birth of the child Zahara, they should add it, otherwise, the claim of 2011, however credible it may seem, should be removed as it is unsourced.",0

 1.WHO is the directing and coordinating authority for health within the United Nations system. It is responsible for providing leadership on global health matters, shaping the health research agenda, setting norms and standards, articulating evidence-based policy options, providing technical support to countries and monitoring and assessing health trends. 

 2.An infection is growth of pathogenic microorganisms in the body, whether or not body function is impaired. Someone with an STI will not necessarily have symptoms or signs that some kind of pathogen is in the body, and might not even feel sick. Someone with an STI can unknowing pass on an infection – if they do not have any signs or symptoms, they are probably not aware they are carrying an infection and may not take the proper precautions of protecting their partner. 

 3.Disease is any change from a state of health; impaired body function. The disease state is associated with the manifestation of symptoms such as fever, pain, aches etc., due to failure of immune system to control in the first round of the growth of infectious agent (s). 

  
 These people don't run around all day looking for euphemisms. The use of the word """"infection"""" instead of """"disease"""" is based on real data,on a real stigma, on a real definition. The main most important point being Someone with an STI will not necessarily have symptoms or signs that some kind of pathogen is in the body, and might not even feel sick.   

 Compare this with HIV and AIDS. Do we use both terms interchangeably? 

  
 It should be stated very clearly in the intro that an infection doesn't imply symptoms. Maybe then this article won't be completely fucking useless. 

  
 PS:There's no reason for this or any article to be locked. The unknown unknown shitholes do far more damage than any """"vandal"""". In fact the name of this article was changed 6 years ago because of some """"anti-establishment"""" piece of shit didn't know the difference between an infection and disease.

If I had to take a wild intutive guess - I would guess that most people will not read the entire article but look for very important information quickly then leave. The project should be built around them. 

 I'm amazed by the astonishing ignorance revealed in the archives of this article. With the rationale of a word being familiar being used to justify against it's change.... jesus fucking chirst.

This month long discussion we are currently in, is the only serious discussion of changing the lead that has been proposed.  The language re: the number and names of the investigations was placed in the lead sometime in late 2006/2007. In September of 09, someone replaced that language with """"Oswald is the assassin"""", which instituted a discussion that lasted half a day.  I replaced that edit with the language that was there until Rudioso showed up about a month ago.  The point in relaying this history is that the edit history does not support that there has been some longstanding feud about the language of this introduction or that mentioning the investigations will somehow allow these discussion to continue.  In fact, the actual history tells us that the only time objections arise is when editors change it to state Oswald is the assassin.  Rudioso is the first and only editor who's objected to the statements of investigations since it's been introduced.  Now, I'm all for trying something new, but I think that since none of the proposals have garnered the support required to claim a new consensus it is best that we go back to what was there before Rudioso briefly objected.

"80 million Turkish speakers outside of Turkey sounds like a pretty extreme guess and merely 55 million in Turkey itself sounds way too low. First off, how many monolingual speakers speak a language other than Turkish? Not all that many, one would imagine. I know for a fact that I've met many Kurds in Sweden that barely speak Kurdish, but speak Turkish fluently. And I was under the impression that the figure of Turks in Germany was closer to 1 million (which is still a lot). I say we should bring the estimates down to very conservative figures unless someone provides reliable source. To me the total 100+ million figure sounds very high.

 == intellexual review == 

 This website has been debated time and time again. It has been removed after much debate spanning over 2 years. There have been many reasons stated for and against this web sites inclusion. But the reasons for its removal was best summed up with  comments 
 :the intellexual.net review is unsigned and is published on what appears to be an unknown individual's personal web site, its subject was a technologically unremarkable product which is long defunct and whose performance may bear little relation to that of its successors, and it discusses the product in a gleefully negative framework that is anything but neutral and unbiased and is thus of dubious value as an encyclopedic link [..] Besides, if that stale and biased review is the most credible link that we skeptics can come up with, I'd say that's pretty sad.   
 So please don't link this site its POV it lacks verifiability and is tested on a particular product not made by Bose since the late 90's.    

 :Yes, but you don't write the rules. There is no wiki rule that says that objective measurements have to be signed, or calibrated, so the comments about the frequency remain. If you can find objective measurements of a Bose system that are more to your liking, please post them. Personally I thought my summary of that page was uncontroversial.   

 ::you don't write the rules??? Ok please try to keep this civil... please! I have only been following them and it is very clear this this is a highly biased page and rather questionable. If you check you would see that it does not meet the standards of Verifiability: 
 ::*third-party published sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy.  
 ::*Questionable sources are those with a poor reputation for fact-checking or with no editorial oversight. Questionable sources should only be used in articles about themselves. (See below.) Articles about such sources should not repeat any contentious claims the source has made about third parties, unless those claims have also been published by reliable sources. 
 ::*Anyone can create a website or pay to have a book published, then claim to be an expert in a certain field. For that reason, self-published books, personal websites, and blogs are largely not acceptable as sources 
 ::**Self-published material may, in some circumstances, be acceptable when produced by an established expert on the topic of the article whose work in the relevant field has previously been published by reliable third-party publications. However, caution should be exercised when using such sources: if the information in question is really worth reporting, someone else is likely to have done so. 
 ::*If no reliable, third-party sources can be found for an article topic, Wikipedia should not have an article on it. 
 ::This web page fails everything, it has NO reputation for fact checking, these claims have not been cited from other reliable 3rd party sources, This person is not an expert or has he been credited as being an expert in the audio field, and has no notable published works aside from this single page.

 ::*Reliable sources are authors or publications regarded as trustworthy or authoritative in relation to the subject at hand 
 ::*Reliable publications are those with an established structure for fact-checking and editorial oversight. 
 ::*In general, an article should use the most reliable and appropriate published sources to cover all majority and significant-minority published views, in line with Wikipedia:Neutral point of view.

 Hey, long time no talk. I'm looking at the PC 2014 RFC and noticed your name supported proposal one and two. Is that possible? Also, is there really any difference between the two?    
 :Hey ! Yes, I supported both because I see instances on which these two might be used. The main difference is that the first proposal is aimed at autoconfirmed users (Use PC2 instead of blocking them, since semiprotection wouldn't work) and the second does not differentiate any use types (applies to all users, and is used as a substitute to full protection). So, I support both because I see PC2 as a plausible solution in many instances where content creation cannot be delayed in spice of having socks or autoconfirmed users edit warring or something.

 ::I find I have to agree with Teque. The introduction, for example, basically notes that some people have positive opinions of non-commercial dog food, and some people have negative opinions of commercial dog food. There is no point in either of those statements. The """"Commercial dog food"""" section appears to make a comparison of canned and dry food, where the facts in question are that dry food is cheaper, lasts longer, and is """"more convenient"""", and that canned food spoils faster but has a longer shelf life, and contains more protein on a dry matter basis. This isn't exactly appropriate, and all of these facts are mentioned again in the article, so this comparison seems intended to criminalize dry dog food. Further, the concept of """"dry matter"""" probably needs to be explained, as anyone who hasn't taken a Nutrition course is unlikely to know what that means. If you dried out wet dog food, and then— without the water weight— compared it on a gram to gram scale with dry dog food, yes, it would have more protein. However, a serving of wet food is mostly moisture, while a serving of dry dog food is mostly dry matter. So, as I understand, a dog gets a higher quantity of protein from a serving of dry food than a serving of wet food. I haven't added this to the article myself because I'm only repeating what I've been taught, I'm not intimately familiar with the subject. Moving on, in the """"Alternate dog food"""" sections, it is insinuated that commercial dog foods have no or significantly less nutritional value than alternate dog foods (freeze dried, I believe, to be specific); a more appropriate statement would possibly be that freeze dried foods retain more of their natural nutrients, while processed foods add nutrients back artificially. Next, the statement """"Many commercial dog foods are made from materials considered unusable or undesirable"""" is entirely opinionated. A statement that some ingredients can be unhealthy could be acceptable if backed by a citation of scientific research. Further, any list of """"contents"""" should not include only """"undesirable"""" ones. It should include all common ingredients. Otherwise, the list should be removed, as it draws focus to those specific ingredients. I just have to note, the only line in this section that suggests dry food has any value whatsoever is that expensive foods may contain """"suitable"""" ingredients. It's true that the cheapest brands have the quality of shoe leather, and any brand with adequate nutrition will be more expensive, but no note is made that the expensive food brands tend to be, nutritionally, very healthy for dogs. As well, there is mention of some of the less savory by products that are allowed into foods by AAFCO, but no mention of the nutritional requirements necessary to be AAFCO certified. I'm not saying that having cow brains in dog food is desirable, but it should also be noted that dog food must meet certain nutritional standards to be AAFCO certified. Generally, the difference is considered to be that between """"complete"""" and """"complete and balanced"""". A dog can survive on a solely complete diet, whereas a balanced diet is actually healthy (and necessary to be AAFCO certified). Interestingly, many prescription diets aren't AAFCO certified, because they will often deliberately reduce some kind of nutrient, like sodium. While this might have ill effects on a typical dog, it's more healthy for one having heart problems. On the same topic, under """"Labeling"""", AAFCO certification is disparaged. However, the only source for this is a person's opinion. The main point seems to be that AAFCO standards are worthless— whether or not they are, I couldn't say— but the point should be that the organization requires food to meet healthier standards. Next, a question— if there's an entire article on 2007 dog food recalls, is it necessary to go into such detail here? A more abridged form, like that used for """"past recalls"""", that directs readers to the separate article might be more appropriate. Overall, the article focuses on negatives of dry dog food and does not allow for the facts that some types of dry dog food are very healthy, that some types of wet food may be unhealthy, or that some alternate foods may not be healthy. Further, there is an over-reliance on this type of statement: """"Some argue..."""" """"Some maintain..."""" """"Proponents criticize..."""" """"Supporters believe..."""" """"Critics argue..."""" The majority of which, I'd like to note, promote negative opinions of dry dog food. Just because it is someone else's opinion, though, does not make it any less of an opinion. Most of these statements lack any support or citations, as well.""",0

There is a fuzzy line between such a system and any OS that provides address space isolation. Or rather there really is no such line, and all such operating systems could be considered in the same category. We wouldn't tend to view them as virtual machine systems today, but they were a huge step forward from earlier approaches to multitasking.

 *I have reworded the Jesus-Trinity passage, mainly including the word Hypostases since the word person can be problematic nowadays (this also provides a prelude to the later word """"hypostatic union""""), and shifting the link to """"Trinity"""".

 *I have also reworded the """"two natures"""" passage, starting with the one person and then stating the two natures.

 ==EAAN== 
 You suggested several times that ID and EAAN are intimately related. You then blocked the discussion, so people can't dicuss the topic anymore. Because of this, I'm posting the arguments in you talk-page. Alternatively you could unlock the discussion page again, because to most people who understand EAAN the article is now in a dissatisfying condition and we'd like to discuss its improvement. 
  It seems there are two main arguments on your side: 
 :Plantinga presented the argument at Intelligent Design conferences (Creationism's Trojan Horse p269). 
 :It has been discussed in a book about ID and its critics. 
 Here is my response. 
 :# The argument is an argument against Naturalism given evolution. It can't be reformed to be an argument against evolution given naturalism, because as Plantinga says himself, """"for the naturalist evolution is the only game in town"""". James Beilby writes in his foreword to Plantingas Argument(Evolutionary Argument against Naturalism - Essays on Plantinga's Evolutionary Argument Against Naturalism, 2002, p. vii)  """"Plantinga's argument should not be mistaken for an argument against evolutionary theory in general or, more specifically, against the claim that humans might have evolved from more primitive life forms. Rather, the purpose of his argument is to show that the denial of the existence of a creative deity is problematic. It is the conjunction of naturalism and evolution that suffers from the crippling deficiency of self-defeat, a deficiency not shared by the conjunction of theism and current evolutionary doctrine."""" The conclusion of the argument is interesting for any non-naturalist or theist (and may be presented at any conference concerning all sorts of theisms/deisms). But this doesn't relate the argumet more intimately to ID than any argument of natural theology. As a matter of fact, an ID proponent has a problem deploying the argument: if he convinces his naturalis friend of the truth of ID instead of evolution, he can't use EAAN anymore, since evolution is a premis of EAAN. 
 :#EAAN is in the book for the mentioned reasons. There is also a chapter on theistic evolution in the book. Yet, theistic evolution clearly isn't related to ID in the sense required by wikipedia. 
 :#Plantinga may or may not agree to evolution. He may even be a proponent of ID (which is not at all clear). But even if he was a fierce proponent of ID, this doesn't automatically relate all his work to ID. I have read quite a lot of Plantingas work (Knowledge of god, god and other minds, naturalism defeated, God, Freedom, and Evil, The Analytic Theist: An Alvin Plantinga Reader and some essays) and he never so much as mentions ID. ID is not present in his work and most notably EAAN is not related to ID, because it has evolution as its premise.  
 I hope to have convinced you that for the sake of the quality of wikipedia the ID passage and tag should be gone. If this is not enough, we'll have to let other people decide who's got the better arguments. 
 Thanks.  """,0

 ::Firstly, making up non existent words such as death crime or death defence to argue that death penalty is inappropriate word is spurious. In fact you are somewhat making my point.  You say capital punishment is tied to capital crime. """"Capital"""" denote ultimate or prime or ultimate, making reference to severity or significance. So it can refer to a city (London) as well as crime or penalty. """"Death"""" is a matter of fact reference to the content. For this reason, death city makes no sense. In reverse, death penalty is more matter of fact (NPOV) reference than capital punishment. Moreover, your claim that that """"We (American?) uniformely describe crimes elibigle for capital punishment as capital crimes"""". A simple google search shows that the claim of uniformality is not sustainable even in U.S.A. 

 ::Secondly, your made a claim in term of general usage. Therefore, google search with few millions sample is infintely more authoritative source than your sample (few entries dictionaries which subsequently equate DP and CP anyway). Even if we somewhat restrict ourselves to academic reference (which include legal dictionary or encycropedia), google scholar search, which make comprehensive search of academic papers, shows that death penalty is more common reference. You can also make few other type of search. Try using google news, which makes comprehensive reference to journalism. It shows overwhelming usage of death penalty over capital punishment. Or try using ask.com search which uses subject-specific link popularity to compute """"authoritativeness"""" of a search result. Again it shows that death penalty is more common reference.  Most top search for DP are from U.S as well. Capital punishment may be more common usage in sentencing which is a specific legal procedure in jurisprudence (which explain legal dictionary reference). This restcited context cannot be used to argue for commonality of usage of capital punishment both in public, journalism and academic world. This is another indication that DP is more NPOV than CP. Anyway, if you want to use few dictionaries entry as your evidence, feel free to do so. We appear to be heading to arbitration process. Consensus is prefered but not to the extent of filbuster. Ultimately, I don't have to convince the opposing advocate(s). I only have to convince the jury (arbitrator) that my case is more NPOV than yours. """,0

 == """"Mutual funds are regulated by the SEC, while hedge funds are not""""/regulation in general == 

 This is simply wrong.  Investment Advisers (the managers of hedge funds) in the US are governed by the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  There are many aspects of the Act that apply both to registered and unregistered advisers.  The most important of these provisions are anti-fraud measures.  The SEC enforces the Act.   

 Registered IAs can count on a visit from the SEC on a schedule determined by the adviser/fund's perceived riskiness.  To try and draw some kind of distinction between an adviser being regulated and a fund being regulated is pointless: when the SEC visits, they are empowered to review all aspects of an adviser's funds. 

 The SEC can use Rule 206(4)-8 under the Act to come in and look at an unregistered adviser's funds, as well.   

 More, it is ludicrous to state that hedge funds are """"largely unregulated,"""" although this phrase is repeated in the popular press frequently.  In the US, hedge funds may be regulated by the SEC, CFTC, FINRA, various SROs and exchanges, state securities regulators, the Department of Labor and maybe others.  In addition to the Act, hedge funds are regulated under the Investment Company Act (for exclusion from the definition of an Investment Company) and the Securities Act of 1933 (Regulation D  concerning sales of private securities).  Any trading by direct investment hedge funds is subject to all the rules of FINRA and the exchanges.   

 If anything, regulation in the UK is even stricter.  Solid regimes exist in other jurisdictions, including Cayman and Bermuda. 

 In short, it is the case in the US and the UK, among other major venues, that hedge funds are (highly) regulated pools of capital.

That includes disclosure of any account used to make an edit from that point forward, as per the condition set within the original ban regarding the condition for unbanning. Disclosure will take place in full adherence to the COI Guidelines. Prior to the ban it was our opinion that it was unclear whether or not COI disclosure was mandatory, and if it had been made known to us that it was mandatory and not an issue for debate, we would never have made previous edits contrary to the guidelines. Now that we know disclosure is mandatory, we have altered our practices to adhere to the new set of rules. I have reviewed the above proposals for how new forms of COI declarations could occur, and state here that WikiExperts is fully willing to work directly with the Community to develop a system of declarations that makes the Community comfortable and provides an additional level of neutral scrutiny for all our contributions. We will not be posting, and have not posted in the past, anything that is/was not meant to help develop a more accurate and better Wikipedia, and we are comfortable working with the Community to prove our work can be beneficial to Wikipedia. Because of previously signed NDAs, we have no ability to reveal the past clients, however, we pledge to no longer sign agreements that would disallow us from full COI disclosure, so that all future work can be verified as within Wikipedia policies and guidelines. The Ethics page on our website already states as such, and past references to confidentiality of the service have been removed. We would very much like to prove that we are not harmful to Wikipedia, and to show that we add neither promotional nor non-notable material to the website when allowed to edit.

 *The A-model photo is in a section that is exclusively talking about D-models. 
 *The A-model photo is on an empty tarmac while the D-model photo was an in-flight combat photo 
 *The A-model photo was oriented away from the text, the D-model photo was oriented towards the text 
 I've moved the A-model photo up in the section, where the prose addresses the use of the A-model, and I've re-inserted the D-model photo back where it was.  That bumps out File:AH-64 Apache 060224.jpg, which is a large and sharper photo, but is a head-on view and does not show the more commonly seen perspective of the aircraft in flight.  I have other photos of the Longbow in flight that are higher resolution, but I will not post for OPSEC reasons.  Perhaps File:AH-64 Apache 060224.jpg could go back into the article under the """"D-Model"""" section, as there are no US D-Model photos, but rather two foreign (Isreal and Singapore) models.  I hope you agree to this reasoning and find my adjustments reasonable and logical.  I hope to work on cleaning up the article in general in the coming weeks. 

 Also, I have a question.  What would you think of using this file as an A-model photo? File:AH-64A at Fort Rucker Sep 1999.jpg.  I know that the pilot (myself) figures prominently, but it is a great photo of an AH-64A, and those just don't grow on trees any more. 

 Thanks.    """,0

 Hi Obi, I'm in the middle of editing at the AR article. Can you say what the tag is for?    
 :I'm trying to complete the merge from the history article. It looked like you had stopped editing... I should be done in a hour or so.   
 :It will confuse the merge if additional edits come in. Thanks.   
 ::No, I haven't stopped yet. But which merge do you mean? We can't merge the histories, so I'm unsure what merge means here.    
 :::not merge histories, but merge changes. I'm trying to merge the changes from the history article (using a 3-way merge), because edits/improvements were made since the branch in 2008. If you could just hold off it would help a great deal - I can't do the merge while someone else is editing. cheers 
 ::::I'm right in the middle of fixing the refs; can it wait until tomorrow? Also, I don't know what you mean by merging the changes. Do you mean you want to add some text to the history section from the former history article? If so, I'm going to rewrite and re-source that entire section (the ancient world section), because the sources aren't the best available. Or have I misunderstood?    
 :::::Yes; actually it would be easier to do now, before you make more changes. I'm trying to capture the differences from the history section, since it was written, since both versions evolved separately. It seems to stem from 2008, when it was moved to a new article; shortly thereafter, you copied the content back, but the split article remained, so the two versions evolved separated. A 3-way merge allows you to captures both sets of changes. See 3-way_merge#Three-way_merge for details. But making more changes, especially re-writes, will just confuse the merge process further.   
 :::::::I wrote the text that was moved to the history article. The additions since then were poorly sourced (e.g. to websites) and I can see factual errors, so they shouldn't be copied over. This is an academic subject, and it has to be based on largely (if not entirely) academic sources. There are plenty available, so there's no reason not to use them. My aim is to update the article to make sure the writing is improved, the sources are the best available, and that the text and the sources agree. Also, there are a few issues that we don't cover at all, or barely allude to, so I'd like to add those too. I can't do it overnight, though, because it's a protracted job.    
 == VN style guide? == 

 You mention a VN style guide, that sometimes allows diacritics? If that's the case it would probably apply to all 6x of the restore Vietnamese RMs currently in. Where is this guide? Thanks.    
 :here: Wikipedia:Naming conventions (Vietnamese); however the guide itself is full of contradictions; it says categories should use diacritics, then it says they shouldn't. But it does allow for the diacritics, if there isn't an established english-language common use. Another start would be modifying/cleaning up that guide.

 == totally wrong ==  

 I have deleted totally the following and I will explain why here.  

 [i]In the British-patterned universities, the Ph.D. program is much shorter because the coursework component is assigned to the masters' and bachelors' degrees, and the Ph.D. course is concerned purely with research for a thesis. The target time is nominally three years, but some students finish earlier, and many take a few years longer. The actual time depends strongly on the discipline being studied.[/i] 

 [b]This is rubbish for the reasons already discussed - while the funding councils are moving towards a model where they want applications to apply for Masters' funding and Ph.D. funding at the same time, there is no """"assignment"""" of coursework to the masters' - it's not actually a requirement to do a masters' before a Ph.D.[/b] 

 [i]British-style bachelors' degrees do not usually require a broad liberal arts and sciences general education component and students are therefore free to concentrate solely on their chosen discipline. The bachelors' degree, if conferred with a high level of 'honours' (i.e. excellent grades), can allow admission to a Ph.D. program without having to first write a masters' thesis. This route is only possible if the university offers an 'honours year' in the field of study, though this is becoming increasingly common due to the greater funding that universities receive for enrolling doctoral students.[/i] 

 This is complete rubbish from start to finish. I have never heard of a british university having a """"honours year"""" - virtually every degree awarded now in the UK has honours attached to it. In theory you can just walk after completing all of your modules and just get (for example) a BA but in practice everyone does their final assignment/project/disseration and gets their honours. The """"honours"""" bit is no indication of excellent grades - you can get a 2:2 and still graduate with a BA(Hons)!

 This article doesn't mention the positive aspect or the value of half-rhyming or slant rhyming that would sometimes attract great poets including Yeats and others. Here are a few attractions of slant rhyme: First, it allows a poet to break away from what Milton complained about in rhyme, or the jingle-jangle of perfect rhymes. It allows the poet to use rhyme but with subtlety, and with the device itself being less assertive. Second, it makes available to the poet yet another tone or quality, a tone that is different, perhaps softer, and novel. Third, it offers the poet opportunities for irony and ironic humor when the rhyme makes an issue of the amount of distance it travels away from a perfect rhyme.",0

 == Dating the translation of Vattel  == 

 The article says: """"An English-language translation of Emerich de Vattel's 1758 treatise The Law of Nations..."""" That's OK, but it's important for clarifying the argument of those who want to make Vattel the controlling authority on the meaning of """"natural born citizen"""" that the English language translation of Vattel that appears in the article is from 1797 and that the 1787 First American Edition of Vattel (when the Federal Convention met) and those before it said something different: """"The natives, or indigenes, are those born in the country of parents who are citizens."""" There is no mention of """"natural-born citizen."""" 

 One way to deal with this is to simply change the article to say """"A 1797 English-language translation..."""" Need this be sourced? It's easy enough to tie the translation to 1797.  Google Books has the 1797 edition online. Sourcing the earlier translation online is a more difficult problem since we're now dealing with rare books.  """,0

 == Begging your pardon for all this... == 

 I have a complicated question. It is to me, at least.  

 So a froofraw has occurred at AN where  nominated dozens of nonfree images to be deleted for not complying with NFCC policy. I got into it because he tagged three images in articles I wrote. (These are the images: 1, 2, and 3) I feel rather certain that I fully justified the inclusion of these images based on my experience writing FAs and GAs. In fact, the third image there was included in a 2009 Featured contact Dispatch about how to write a fair use rationale. But now I get from the disjointed discussion that the issue of """"transformative use"""" is undecided and without consensus. According to those pushing for transformative use, a historical image has to be involved in the article, which qualifies for the historical images in Birmingham campaign, which I wrote.  

 I apologize because this is now so spread out I can't keep track of it anymore. There is the AN discussion here, an RfC about the issue of transformative use, which I can't even track it's so all over the place, and the discussions about each of the images that were tagged for deletion (start there and scroll down). 

 # I'm asking you if you can shed any light on this, specifically what I need to do to keep the images in the articles, because you have in the past treated intelligent editors looking to do the right thing with respect. I'm not seeing this in the other discussions. Not that I'm surprised. 
 # It's my contention that when other editors insist on bulky justification of images in article prose that does not reflect the weight of what sources say about the images, that that is a violation of WP:UNDUE and is a form of original research. I thinkand I'm not clear about what is being asked or demanded of methat a couple other editors are insisting that I make a section in the article about the image in order to keep it in the article. If, for example, three sources state that the image of Emmett Till's uncle is significant and they devote half a page in each book to how significant it is, but in the overall scheme of Emmett Till's story that is decreased to three sentences, would it not be OR to inflate how much prose is dedicated to the image?   
 # Why is the issue of what qualifies as fair use in images left up to consensus? Why haven't copyright attorneys taken this over? It seems if Wikipedia is doing something illegal or extralegal that there should be no questions about what qualifies as NFCC. I think part of why I'm so confused is that the editors insisting that the images be deleted are unsure of the legal literature themselves and have replaced clarity with force, pseudo-authority, and confusing language. Not that I'm surprised. 

 I learned how to justify images by being schooled by , who is semi-retired. He did pop into the FfD discussion for the Stonewall riots image to say that the """"transformative use"""" interpretation of the NFCC rule is """"a profound misunderstanding and misapplication of NFCC and sourcing policies"""". I'm not a copyright attorney. I can't parse all this. I just don't want the articles' qualities decreased because someone went on a deletion tear when none of the rules are clear.   """,0

 == Proposed change == 

 I have been making general observations regarding the article and expressing my opinion that it should be made more general, less technical, and focus exclusively on what global warming is, using wikilinks to other more detailed articles to address the role of the IPCC, various climatic models, and proposed corrective actions. This proposed lede was taken largely from the current article lede, just generalized and heavily trimmed. Is there any support among the editors for revising the article in the same manner?   

 Although the terms """"global warming"""" and """"global cooling"""" can be used to describe cyclic variations in global temperature, the term """"global warming"""" has been generally used since the mid-1970's to describe the current global warming event, which dates from the mid-1700's. Since the late 1800's, measured average global temperature has risen approximately 0.74°C(ref)NOAA Global Warming FAQ(/ref), and further warming is predicted by reputable scientific organizations including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC.  

 Predicted impacts of global warming include: rising sea levels; changes in the amount and pattern of precipitation; an expansion of subtropical deserts; the retreat of glaciers; permafrost and sea ice; more frequent occurrence of extreme weather events including heatwaves, droughts and heavy rainfall events; species extinctions due to shifting temperature regimes; and changes in agricultural yields. 

 The current rise in global temperatures has been fairly rapid, and is attributed in large part to the presence of human-produced greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Although greenhouse gases can be produced by natural events (volcanos, for example), the vast majority of scientists believe that the additional human sources such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and agricultural activity have created an imbalance in the global temperature-regulation system, and that corrective actions to reduce those human sources should be taken. 
     

 :I don't like it, and it contains several claims that are either wrong, irrelevant, or misleading. First, the initial hedge (""""can be used"""") adds no useful information. Secondly, global warming is overwhelmingly used not to refer to warming since the mid 1700s, but for the mostly anthropogenic warming in the 20th and 21st century. The 0.74 is since the late 19th century - it's easy to misread """"late 1800's"""" as 1800. I'm not really happy by the """"warming is predicted by organizations"""" - many individual scientists do so as well. """"permafrost and sea ice"""" are not a predicted impact (changes to them are). """"Fairly rapid"""" is a very weak statement - as far as we know, it's extremely rapid. Also, if it's current, it should be """"is"""", not """"has been"""". I like the """"attributed in large part"""", but we should mention the rapid increase in human-produced greenhouse gases, not just their presence (they have been present, to some degree or other, for 200000 years). The natural sources of GHGs are a red herring here - the increase is clearly anthropogenic, and only a very small fringe thinks otherwise. I'm not to happy about the """"imbalance in the global temperature-regulation system"""" - what would that system be?  Finally, I would clearly separate the corrective actions from the recognition of anthropogenic warming - you will probably find all combinations (""""human-caused, no action"""" (I think Lombog now falls into that group), """"human caused, action"""" (many there), """"not human-caused, no action"""" (strict deniers), and even """"not human caused, action anyways"""" (e.g. from people who are concerned about energy resources).    

 :: Me either, for all of Stephan's reasons, plus (A) I dislike bulk changes and prefer you take smaller bites so we can zero in, (B) by starting this new thread you are sort of whitewashing the fact that you tried to win a consensus to do a major overhaul along these lines in your prior thread titled """"observations"""", and you failed to win that consensus, (C) I'm unwilling to embrace bulk edits by someone who admits they don't understand basic terms and can't supply citations for the changes they wish to make, as you admitted in that prior thread.

 No problem, I think though the new rewording sounds a lot better and is more iinformative and I can see your points regarding the data being more suitable to be added to the depersonalisation article. Sorry if I got carried away. I usually do keep my cool on wikipedia. I think the triggering of DPD is like where someone gets really stoned either a s aonce off or a period of use or takes LSD or psylocibin a couple of times or once and then triggers depersonalisation disorder. I guess I am coming from the perspective or depersonalisation caused by a chronic insult to the nervous system, i.e. severe distortion of brain chemistry due to chronic dependence (upregulation, down regulation of transmitter systems) and/or from withdrawal. For example I have never heard of someone going and getting drunk and then waking up the next day with (triggered) depersonalisation or some other major mental health disorder but I have heard and it is well known that alcohol dependence and misuse over a prolonged period of time can cause a range of neuropsychiatric disorders. Infact I was talking to a psychiatrist and he said that the most common causes of depersonalisation like symptoms that he sees in his practice is either from cannabis or the consequences of alcoholism and he says as far as alcoholism he has seen people recover after up to 10 years of abstinence or in some cases never. He works with a lot of people who have mental health problems from drug abuse and/or dependence. There is no ill feeling at all from my point of view.

Mr. Shakti Das started his career in Avaition Industry and after working for almost six years decided to get into handicraft business with a view to take forward the legacy of Mr. Sushil Kumar Das. This website is dedicated only to export of Bamboo and Cane made Handicraft from North Eastern India , which is well known all over the world for its excellent quality bamboo and cane. North East Handicraft Product , a company formed in the year 2010 by Mr. Manoranjan Das with Mr. Shakti Das based in Bangalore has been very successful in making the people aware of handicraft use and how it help us to save the environment. Catering only to Indian people we came out with a idea that we should focus on worldwide about the benefits of handicraft and how it help us to serve for a noble cause , we started SHAKTI EXPORT. Initially we will concentrate on small products and gradually launch the large products like Sofa Set , Bed etc made of Bamboo and Cane. However we will also export products for other companies whenever required as we have a tie up with excellent shipment / courier companies here in India. 

 We have our own production unit manufacturing Bamboo and Cane Handicrafts. 80 percent unskilled and 20 percent unskilled is the ratio of our work force. As this hand made products are made by the village people in the interior area which are their source of income , we do the marketing and present their beautiful products worldwide where-by it help the people to earn a livelihood. 

 Presently we have tie up with 10 plus online partner companies which sell this hand made products online. As we ventured into export business now we have been working hard to present it before the international market.

 == Why is this even neccesary? == 

 Why does there have to be an article on people? Hopefully everyone knows who people are (unless they are not people...?) This article is, in my opinion, unneccesary. Please correct me if i am wrong, but to me, this is just unneccesary.  

 : I agree with your sentiment. 

  
 I agree that this article is not necessary. The word """"People"""" belongs in a dictionary not an encyclopedia. I'm new to Wikipedia, but does anyone agree that this page is a candidate for deletion and if so, do they know how to start the deletion process?

While this is indeed true, almost everyone knows what food is, yet we have an article on that too. I'm sure there's some way to expand on this - perhaps something about different ethnicities? Maybe the distribution of people across the world? Let me know what you think. Cheers,    
 :::::For me it's a question of """"too obvious to include"""", but perhaps this only applies to the dismal state of the page at present.

"""Under """"Early Childhood"""" it states: """"His birth was registered with both the U.S. authorities and the city's British Consulate, with the child thus being awarded both American and British citizenship."""" In fact registration of a birth has nothing to do with attribution of U.S. nationality, or for that matter, British nationality (given the facts of parentage and the birth of a parent in Britain). A certification of birth is an entitlement (under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child) and under New York and Federal law. But many births in the past were never registered, and some, typically signed by midwives in border states, have been questioned (typically by the State Department upon application for a passport or (prior to current passport rules) on re-entry from Mexico) as fraudulent. 

 It is questioned (above in this Talk section) whether Johnson actually renounced his US nationality when he said he had, or would do. And it is also stated that renunciation is contingent upon payment of tax. Johnson did not (it is not quickly done, there is a long waiting list with the Consular Sections in London, Edinburgh and Belfast) but I suppose he will do. The tax issue is more complex: there is an exit tax, quite onerous for """"covered expatriates""""  generally speaking those with assets over $2 million or an tax bill of $155,000 (as of 2013). There are also other tax implications relating to gifts and estates. There is a concession for persons born to alien parents who renounce by age 18-1.2: https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/877  

 It is quite possible to be a non-citizen  even to have been deported as an illegal alien  and still be liable for U.S. tax, perhaps indefinitely, Indeed long-term green-card holders are also subject to the exit tax system.

 This one is tricky because both sides have valid points.  I need to hunt down references to support it but I undestand the Southern argument that the house was in such a commanding position that it really was not suitable as a hospital, and putting a hospital flag on it to prevent if from being used that way was unacceptable.  On the other hand the lack of attention to defending it suggests that Mulligan's intentions were that it would be sufficiently in the rear that it would be a good site.  My personal interpretation is that he or someone before him miscalculated and assumed that there would not be any force chosing to place itself between there and the river.  At any rate, I see both sides as having merit.   

 Similarly, when it was taken the Federals who retook it had been instructed to consider those holding it in violation of the Laws of War.  The MSG inside didn't just up and surrender, they were overwhelmed and compelled to surrender after inflicting considerable casualties.  Again, both points of view have some validity.  Interestingly, those who executed the men in the hospital don't seem to have been singled out and executed by the MSG following the battle.

First, it’s not an efficient way to select for traits, like altruistic behavior, that are supposed to be detrimental to the individual but good for the group. Groups divide to form other groups much less often than organisms reproduce to form other organisms, so group selection for altruism would be unlikely to override the tendency of each group to quickly lose its altruists through natural selection favoring cheaters. Further, we simply have little evidence that selection on groups has promoted the evolution of any trait. Finally, other, more plausible evolutionary forces, like direct selection on individuals for reciprocal support, could have made us prosocial.

 Hrmm, 3 paragraphs for VSU, 7 against. This seems a little biased. I'll try and beef up the pro side if I know the zealots won't delete it. 

  

 how many universities would be effected by Federal enactment of VSU?   

 All of the publicly owned ones (ie. not Bond or ACU;): to my knowledge, there's not a single public uni in Australia where student organisation membership is currently optional.   

 ==Motivations of the ALSF== 

 The article states (or should state): 

 *Liberal Students argue strongly for VSU on the basis of freedom of association and other grounds; 
 *They deny the charge that they are arguing for VSU on the basis of political disadvantage for their opponents; 
 *VSU advocates on the other hand consistently and routinely accuse Liberals of  supporting the change for political motivations. 

 I will undo any changes to the article that do not substantially agree with this situation, as it is simply a matter of objective fact, favouring no particular side.   

 ===== 

 I don't know why you are bringing so much politics into this.  

 """"Liberal Students argue strongly for VSU on the basis of freedom of association and other grounds"""" 

 Thats a very big blanket statement. So you are saying Liberal Students, as a whole, fit your reasoning? You can't possibly know that unless you have questioned every one. Thats what I'm objecting to. FYI I'm not a liberal, and wish Latham had won. I do support freedom of choice. 

 By the way, I apoligize for the 'commie' remark. 

 :That's perfectly alright. Politics plays a very large part in this: it is a point of conflict over the government's legislation after all, and was debated by both sides in the House of Representatives and the Senate when it came up, with the Liberals arguing in favour of VSU and Labor arguing in favour of USU. At the last election, the ALP's policy supported USU and the Coalition supported VSU. 

 ::Yes, but you are missing my point. I objected to the blanket language that implied that _all_ students who identified as X thought Y.   

 :And the """"freedom of choice"""" argument really only appears because some students argue that they should be free to choose not to support the politics of their student organisation.  

 ::Hang on, I don't follow you here. Personally I think that Student Unions should stay out of politics not directly relating to education. Even if the unions didn't play politican, I still would support VSU. If some students want bands, clubs, so-called subsidised food etc, they should pay for it themselves. The """"Freedom of Choice"""" argument still applies even if you ignore the political side of things.  

 By contrast, if a Liberal group gained control of a USU supporter's student organisation, that USU supporter would still not argue in favour of VSU because they still support USU philosophically (as indeed has happened at a few campuses). So the """"freedom of choice"""" argument is underlined by differences in political opinion. If there was no objection to the political content, the advocates wouldn't be arguing the need to make the choice. 

 :: I disagree. See above. 

  
 :The point is, I'm not taking a stand one way or the other over whether Liberals *are* supporting it for political motivations, I'm saying that USU supporters *say* that Liberals are supporting it for political motivations (Many sources for this: virtually every NUS press release argues this point).  If, as you say, you're not a Liberal, this clearly doesn't apply to you. The article mentions that VSU supporters deny this claim. NPOV policy simply requires that we detail the substance of both sides' arguments without putting a judgement on their validity.

 == Is the """"Kifu"""" recording system used to record Shogi games? == 

 Kifu is the system for recording games of Go.

The Kifu topic page was included in category Shogi, and said that it was also used for Shogi, but I see nothing on this page about it and I don't see how it would be applicable to a game where the pieces move about.

 You're right, I forgot all about the related changes trick. So I guess technically it is possible for me to have a watchlist, if I just manually list them. Thanks for that insight. 

 There are also benefits to not having a watchlist, though, the most salient of which is that there's no watchlist to eat up all your time. This should not be underestimated. -) 

 I'm a hit-and-run editor, so watchlists don't work too well for me—I don't want to get bogged down in looking at an article because I happened to edit it a month ago, say. At present, I'm using my contribution list to keep track of my most recent edits (for the incidental discussion on talk pages et al.), and that works quite well. Thanks for the idea, though.

The reality is that there is not too much different between most 14 year-olds and 15 year-olds. However, the law """"pretends"""" that there is a difference and draws a distinction for everyone regardless of an individual's actual capacity. Thus, the age of consent is a Legal fiction.

 Firstly, it sounds as if wikipedia was stating that Øvrebø's performance was the actual and only reason for Chelsea not winning. And secondly, we could write a similar sentence next to practically each and every game of football. This sentence does not belong here as it hints to an intentional discrimination of Chelsea by the referee and the UEFA.

 As I stated in the previous RfC about Michael Lucas's biography, manufacturer PR material about a product is generally acceptable as an encyclopedic source.  If editors who disagree with the company position find evidence to the contrary in other published sources that meet WP:V - such as a film review in an established magazine or newspaper - then that opinion may be cited alongside the manufacturer statement.  While it may be possible that the film producers cited the public domain novel instead of the copyrighted film for legal reasons, it would violate WP:NOR to advance that view without a verifiable source for the claim and it would violate WP:NPOV to exclude the production company's position.

"The connection with the stopped watch is that in both cases there's a solution that works only if you ask the question for which it (the watch, or the simple solution) produces the correct answer.  It's like using Pythagoras' theorem to determine the length of the third side of a 6-8-X triangle without saying anything about whether the triangle is a right triangle.  Yes, X is 10 if the triangle is a right triangle, but Pythagoras' theorem only applies if the triangle is a right triangle, so unless it's given that the triangle is a right triangle or you can somehow show the triangle must be a right triangle based on what's given, using Pythagoras' theorem is unjustified.  Similarly, showing that the unconditional probability of winning by switching is 2/3 for the MHP (which is what the simple solutions do) when asked about the conditional probability is not a complete answer unless you also say something about why these two probabilities must be the same. 

 :::::::::You don't need to take my word for this - it's exactly what Morgan et al., and Gillman, and Lucas, Rosenhouse, and Schepler, and Rosenthal, and Grinstead and Snell, and the others I keep mentioning are saying.   And, since Wikipedia doesn't care what you think or what I think, and there are plenty of reliable sources that present unconditional solutions without justifying their answer must be the same as the conditional probability it's perfectly fine to present these sorts of solutions.  What I'm saying is NOT fine is presenting these solutions as if they are the undisputed way the problem should be approached.

"Kirsten Heiberg was automatically a German citizen when she married Franz Grothe in Oslo in May 1938. This was very important to her, as German authorities insisted on the fact that only German citizens could be members of the Filmkammer, which again was neccessary to obtain permission to act. Non-members of the Filmkammer could normally not get permission to act in German films. For her first three films, Kirsten Heiberg was given special contract, giving her a much lower salary than Filmkammer members were given. (  )",0

"== The Great Departure == 

 There are some disputes regarding the great departure of Buddha. The reason described in the article is about a dead person, a sick, and an old man. This view is described but not properly referenced in the article. 

 Another, and more justifiable, reason is given in the book The Buddha and His Dhamma by Dr. Ambedkar.  He writes in its prolouge: 

 The first problem relates to the main event in the life of the Buddha, namely, Parivraja. Why did the Buddha take Parivraja? The traditional answer is that he took Parivraja because he saw a dead person, a sick person and an old person. This answer is absurd on the face of it. The Buddha took Parivraja at the age of 29. If he took Parivraja as a result of these three sights, how is it he did not see these three sights earlier? These are common events occurring by hundreds, and the Buddha could not have failed to come across them earlier. It is impossible to accept the traditional explanation that this was the first time he saw them. The explanation is not plausible and does not appeal to reason. But if this is not the answer to the question, what is the real answer?  

 He gives the real answer in the first part of the book, From Birth to Parivajra. This should be taken in account and must be included in the article.",0

 :Your lack of a sense of humour appals me. I will leave my Joyce quotation off the talk page since you made such a bloody issue of it. It was a joke for Sarah777, sympathising with the frustration that led her to paste that text on the talk page. It was my intention to leave it there for 24 or 48 hours to give her a chance to see it, then I intended to wipe the whole thing. There is another thing that burns me: it is appropriate for an editor to change an article, but a talk page is where people talk, and you should leave talk unmolested unless something seriously egregious has been written there.

 == Discussion of final paragraphs == 

 The article as it now stands emphasizes the final two paragraphs of Franklin's essay. I argue this gives it undue weight. We noted that the essay """"... was cited by Adam Smith, David Hume, Samuel Johnson, Richard Price and William Godwin. It influenced Thomas Malthus in An Essay on the Principle of Population and, through Malthus, Charles Darwin."""" This is clearly a more substantial statement on its historical importance through out history and the world. The fact that Franklin's aversion to non-WASP immigration is something abhorrent to Western mores today is worthy of note but it was merely a footnote that Franklin threw in the end. It wasn't the main topic of his work. The article is about his work; and the modern reaction to a single paragraph shouldn't dominate the article.   """,0

 I am a huge f.a.g.g.o.t. 

 I have a small dick and will most probably die single, divorced, lonely, and in pain cause I am a flaming republican Ho.mo.sexual who hasn't come out of the closet yet. 

 republican is the type of person who is a part of the ignorant of the masses, and really is not doing anything for the good of the country. They think that they are the """"patriotic ones"""", but is killing the innocent a patriotic idea? Are usually pro-life people but support the death penalty and for no reason, being in Iraq and being responsible for the death of the innocent. Like George Dubya Bush, and think turning the USA into Big Brother's house is the path of succes for America. These people should be considered dangerous and stuipd, and should be tried for crimes against humanity, integration of church and state, and violations to the US Constitution. 

  
 A RepubliCon is someone who, in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary, is able to manipulate large, vapid, weak-minded audiences by means of manipulation, deception, distortion of facts, and incomplete information. He is a con-artist with an inability to think objectively, consider alternatives, and allow for dissention. A RepubliCon appeals to intellectually conservative, mindless and often dimwitted followers. These followers are regressive lemmings who will follow the RepubliCon’s faithfully regardless of the inevitably tragic conclusion. I cannot understand how those RepubliCon's like Rush Limbaugh and Bill O'Reilly can charge up their audiences when they are clearly passing their subjective, distorted views as fact. —Preceding unsigned comment added by

 :Heh, I remember asking this question a couple of years ago when I was newer and having a great deal of trouble getting any kind of """"rule""""-oriented answer. I have a vague recollection that I found something I could point to, but if I did, I can't find it now. Then, after a while, I realized it was fairly standard, at least for experienced editors, to remove pre-production films from tables, so I just forgot about it and automatically do it. I see people cite to WP:CRYSTAL, but that, of course, doesn't specifically address filmographies, so it's a much more generalized and fluid concept and ultimately a judgment call. Some even cite to WP:NFF,even though it's a notability guideline, for the notion that if you can't have a film article about a film that isn't in production, you can't have an entry in a film table, either. Not altogether satisfying as someone may always point out that notability doesn't affect content, just creation. 

 :I keep thinking that if I search hard enough, I'll find something, but the closest I came was a discussion I was involved in with no good answer from WP:FILM. 

 :Sorry. If you do find anything, please let me know; I, of course, will do the same.  """,0
"""::Hmm...I think the difficulty is that in these arguments there are a lot of different issues.  For example, in the absolutism/relationalism stuff...the argument takes on a very specific tone in the primary texts that is pretty anachronistic (space as """"sensorium"""" in Clarke's letters for example)  So, I suppose it's useful to put these things into a more analytic framework whereby the issues really are these two: 

 1. Is Space-time an object (instead of substance)? and 
 2. Are there """"facts of the matter"""" concering spatio-temporal determinations (e.g. location)? 

 In general, then, an Idealist will certainly say no to (1), while it will depend what sort of anti-realism you subscribe to to know the answer to (1) (for example I think Putnam would say that spacetime is an object, per his system, but that VanFraassen would not). 

 But the answer to (2) is a bit complicated.  Leibniz, for example, although he didn't believe that spacetime was an object, does believe there are facts of the matter concerning the lengths of spatial intervals.  Conversely, Grunbaum, a realist about spacetime as an object, thought that all spatio-temporal determinations were conventional, i.e. set by some (arbitrary) co-ordinative definition.  To complicate matters again, Reichenbach held the self-same view about facts of the matter concerning spatiotemporal determinations, but was very much in the phenomenalist spirit of the positivists in general, and their neo-Kantian Plus view of the role of conceptualization in the setting of facts. 

 So I don't know, I get worried about the use of idealism and anti-realism in such close proximity to one another as they really are two different creatures.  Take for example the flow of time issue (I kind of short shrifted this section...should have said more probably).  Take the """"B-Theorist"""" solution to Mctaggart's paradox.  On this view, the paradox doesn't arise because a) A-determinations can be reduced to B-determinations (via some """"token-reflexive account"""" or what have you...where what """"It is raining now"""" comes out to / has as truth conditions """"The tokening of 'It is raining now' is simultaneous with it raining"""") and b) real change can be found in the B-series alone. 

 So, for a B-theorist the flow of time is merely a feature of our experience of time, not found in some objectively moving NOW.  Certainly we would call a b-theorist an anti-realist about the flow of time...but idealist?  I wouldn't think so...as they believe time (as the B-series) to be what it is independent of observers.  But again, to further muck up matters a B-theorist could still be a relationalist about spacetime (spacetime not an object but just a system of relations among events) and a conventionalist about spacetime determinations (e.g. lengths between objects).

"Xerpheric Records Ltd. Founded in the UK, 2009 by Mark Flanagan. Xerpheric is not only a new label, but also a new word. This was to secure an original name that had not been registered by anyone before, for anything.  

 Originally, Mark Flanagan, ( from Feltham, in West London ) an artist, programmer, engineer & producer of abstract ambient tachno trance traded under the name; Headstate 68, and was set up in the attic studio, The Loft, Feltham, in 2007.  

 As an avid guitarist, Mark decided that he wanted guitaring in the tracks, but more akin to the electronic vibe. So he then set to work on his tunes, refining hooks and riffs, with trippy dubs to create the unique sound he was after. 

 However, in 2008, situations forced the move to a new studio, The Meads, in Chertsey, Surrey. The act then created a portal on Myspace to enable the world to listen to the tracks created, to guage how popular this type of music would be.  
 A reasonable success was apparent and therefore, these tracks were mastered and released on the album, Axatron on Apple's i.tunes for MP3 download, in February 2009. 

 Headstate 68's music was original and new, however, with material created by Mark Flanagan, dating back to 10 years it quickly became apparent that these older tracks, that represented the different genres of electronic dance music, that were never released, could be re-generated, re-programmed and re-mastered. However, not sounding like the classic slow tempo, guitar laden sound of Headstate 68's other acts were required to present these tracks to the populus. 

 Xerpheric Records Ltd was created in  March, 2009 to house these different types of electronic dance music and so the acts were created. 

 The following acts are currently signed to Xerpheric Records Ltd.  

 Headstate 68, Technoid Funk Master, The Retro System, Energy Generation & The Sound of Tronic Bionic UK. 

 At present, all the acts are working on material and will post 10 tracks on Myspace, then will be also released on i.tunes. 
 Once this has been acheived, the albums will be released on cd through the label website; xerpheric-record.com

""" Armenian Genocide == 
 Am I missing this?  Why isn't it included?  Please leave note on my Discussion page, thanks.  

 :Because it happened before the Genocide Convention and is an alleged genocide. See the section (and the main article) Genocide in history where many other alledged genocides and genocides are listed  

 The only reason it is considered 'alleged' is because modern-day Turkey (and its exclaves) deny it. The majority of the western academic world accepts and defines it as genocide. It certainly should be listed, particularly seeing as how it was used as an example in coining the word (see Raphael Lemkin).  

 :There was no international tribunal to try the perpetrators. Those who were tried were tried under domestic laws and as there was no such offence as genocide at that time so if they were found guilty they were found guilty of other crimes. There should not be any listing of the genocide  here because it is covered in the Genocide in history and it is only an alleged genocide given that there was no guilty verdict handed down by an international tribunal. The perpetrators of the Holocaust were not found guilty of Genocide but of crimes against humanity, but they were found guilty by an international tribunal of those crimes. I think it better that only incidents where people are found guilty of Genocide are listed in this article. Those incidents before the Convention, or incidents where there was not a trial, are listed in the article Genocide in history as it stops this article being the focus of POV wars.    

 ::Talat, Enver and Cemal all fled turkey before they could be tried under any court (though a Turkish military tribunal did try them in abstentia and find them guilty of war crimes) and all were killed ( Enver in Russia, Talat in Germany, and Cemal in Georgia) within 7 years. Just because the guilty parties fled justice (and because the Turkish tribunal is not international) does not mean these events did not occur. If the League of Nations, which had only been established only a year before Tallat’s death, had managed to apprehend these war criminals, then it surely would have found them guilty. The fact that a national court – the very nation they had controlled - found them guilty should be worth something.  

 ::: Although the information given in the article is the academic and judicial meaning of genocide, some critics are ultimately political. Cemal Pasha found guilty by the Ottoman Empire not because of he interfered any mass killing but beause he provoked the ethnic Arabs for a rebellion movement. The other misleading point is their murders. Cemal Pasha was murdered by Armenian paralimilitary groups in Tbilisi on 22nd July 1922, Talat Pasha was killed by an Armenian named Sogomon Tehliryan in Germany in 1921 and Enver Pasha was killed in Tajikistan on the 4th of August 1922 in battlefield.

 I can appreciate it that you have a personal point of view about using the term Armenian genocide.

"Some Corrections 

 Props to Shiraz4 for the organizing of the Kongo kings into houses. However, there are errors in the assignment which I have sought to correct.  In the seventeenth century, it's clear that the acession of Alvaro I marks the advent of the house of Kwilu, and the other houses are also well documented.  For the later 18th and 19th century we need to do more research before we can assign house membership, as, although sources of the time refer to two or three houses, they don't always name them (this would be the Castello de Vide and Raimondo da Dicomano reports).  Hints about this are found in traditions, as recorded in Nkutama a mvila za makanda, and Kinkulu kia Nsi Eto, and their names might still be recoverable.  However, to do this would be to provide original research and until that is published it seems premature to put it in Wikipedia.

 Shortly after wrapping up JJ's original solo series the article states, """"His appearances with the [Justice] League kept him in the public eye long after his own series was cancelled....From the late 1960s until the late 1970s, J'onn was absent from the JLA, having left Earth to find and become leader of New Mars. This time period is later retconned during the Crisis on Infinite Earths, and his period of absence is never again referenced."""" Not so. Shortly after his HoM feature ended, he made his first appearance in JLA in some time, leaving Earth with the Martians who have finally come for him. After this, he made very sporadic appearances for over a decade. He teamed up with Superman while World's Finest Comics was temporarily Batman-less, appeared in one 1974 issue of JLA, had a three-issue back-up miniseries in Adventure Comics that led directly into a team-up with Supes and Bats in World's Finest, did another isolated guest shot in JLA (playing cosmic-level chess with Despero), and permanently resurfaced in JLA when the book was severely reformatted (the satellite HQ was destroyed, Aquaman became chairman, new members included the similarly enhanced son of Steel the Indestructible Man, and a break-dancer). I don't think I missed anything. Over the course of these appearances, things on New Mars were developed. I am also unaware of any retconning away, via Crisis or any other way, of this period. Indeed, the early issues of the John Ostrander-written Martian Manhunter series (all I read because understanding the plot required more knowledge of what was going on in the League's own series than I had or wanted to get) seemed to deal with J'onzz's off-Earth period heavily, contradicting this assertion.

I have fixed up most of the cases of this in the article – this is just for future reference.

 I have looked at some other related articles and here is my complete proposal: 
 *The article Yaghan should be abnout the Yaghan people and have a link in the top to the Yaghan language. The Fuegians article should be moved here because that article as it is now is about the Yaghan people. 
 *The Fuegians article (that is empty after the move) should be turn into a disambiguation with some explaniation about the usage of term and have the following links to: Selknam, Kaweshakar, Yaghan and their respective languages.   
 *The Yagan article that is about a kind of aboriginal warriors in Australia should have links in the top to Yaghan language and Yaghan (the people). 
 *The Yámana article  that actually redircts to Yaghan language should redirect instead to the Yaghan article that is about the people. 
 *The Yamana article that is a disambiguation should include a link to Yaghan (the people).

"Had Edward VIII not abdicated, he may well have died before 1972 - and Prince Albert, Duke of York (George VI) may have lived much longer due to not having the stress of being King during WWII. Therefore, if Edward VIII was indeed incapable of fathering children, and died in say the 1950s, he would have been succeeded by his younger brother Prince Albert, who would have become George VI anyway...only much later. When he died, say, in the 1960s-80s, presuming he had no sons (only Elizabeth and Margaret), Elizabeth would then have still become Elizabeth II. However, it is very questionable whether she would have married Prince Philip of Greece had her father not been King in 1947; therefore, she may have had either different children, or no children.

 History & Growth 

 ATIC was established in 2008. Through a joint venture, ATIC and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) created the world's third largest independent foundry GlobalFoundries in early 2009.[3] 
 In late 2009, ATIC acquired Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing of Singapore, the world's second largest dedicated independent semiconductor foundry.[4][5] 
 In January 2010, GlobalFoundries officially integrated operations with Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing, and since that time have functioned as one company under the GlobalFoundries brand.[6]  
 (add) Since the integration of Chartered, GLOBALFOUNDRIES has grown to become the world’s second largest foundry company by revenue, and has a employee footprint of over 13,000 worldwide.  
 In August 2010, ATIC joined with other investors to fund Texas-based Calxeda, a start-up company which will eventually provide ARM-based computers for the server market.[7] 
 ATIC simultaneously “worked with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to develop a masters program in microelectronics at the Masdar Institute of Science and Technology in Abu Dhabi.”[8][9] 
 Also in 2010, ATIC joined a university research partnership with the Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC) to conduct research in the Abu Dhabi region.[10] 
 In 2011, ATIC announced investments of $5.5 billion to expand manufacturing in Singapore, Dresden, Germany, and Saratoga County in New York state.[11][12] 
 ATIC also announced a $6–$8 billion computer chip factory in Abu Dhabi in development for completion in 2012.[13]  

 (add) While the initial Abu Dhabi was placed on hold due to larger economic circumstances, ATIC continues to pursue plans to build a fabrication facility within the Emirate. http://www.thenational.ae/business/industry-insights/technology/globalfoundries-in-profit-by-2015 

 (Add section) R&D 
 Towards; building a globally-competitive technology R&D; ecosystem within Abu Dhabi, ATIC has invested more than Dh100 million in research grants and funds since 2009.  
 http://www.thenational.ae/business/industry-insights/technology/abu-dhabi-eyes-growth-through-innovation 

 Research Grants 
 ATIC partners  with the Semiconductor Research Corporation, a leading university-research consortium, to drive local research towards minimum energy electronic systems. 
 This year, ATIC is supporting research initiatives spanning Khalifa University, UAE University, American University of Sharjah, Masdar Institute and New York University Abu Dhabi.

 ACE4S  
 In May, 2013, ATIC and the Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC) launched the ATIC-SRC Centre of Excellence for Energy Efficient Electronic Systems (ACE4S), to be hosted jointly in Abu Dhabi by Khalifa University of Science, Technology and Research, and Masdar Institute of Science and Technology.

 But if we ask whether Dai Sato’s works are appreciated domestically in Japan, we find that they come under harsh criticism, such as Eureka Seven for example. Why are they criticized? Why did Sato write Eureka Seven willingly, despite the foreseen criticism? Such contexts are almost never mentioned abroad. 

 ...DS: One thing I can say is that my work tends to enjoy a better reputation abroad than in Japan. This might be because the images of my work have, ironically, helped define “Japanimation” for non-Japanese audiences. If this is the case, it didn’t happen consciously on my part. The particular works which have influenced us in turn, happened to come from cultures of Europe and the U.S. I don’t think anybody here has seen Eureka Seven, but I applied dance music and subcultural references to the script, two things that are essential for me. This may sound trivial, but it is quite interesting that a kind of a debate between subculture and otaku exists in Japan. I feel like I’ve been positioned at the very center of this…so I feel awkward having my works walk on their own. I don’t know if this answered the question… 

 ...If you ask me what music means for me… we are conversing by words now, right? I also use words for my profession, but they are powerless. I wish that I could speak with you directly now, but my words do not live in the same world as yours. But music is different. I run a music label, and it is for dance music. I love techno, house and also hip hop. I believe in the powers they have. This is why the theme of the next anime, Eureka Seven, is the rise and fall of techno, starting from New Wave to Manchester. I wanted to write a story of youths who live in a world that has already ended; with recognition that the term “New Wave” is no longer “new.” This is why I’ve chosen dance music, techno and house as a theme, instead of hip-hop this time.

 The extremes of both the left and the right have hijacked Enoch Powell. The left use him (incorrectly, in my view) as a leader of the racist parts of our political system. The racist part of the political right also misunderstand his views and claim him as one of their own. So the left want nothing except Powell's supposed racism to appear in any Wikipedia article about him, whilst the right also want Powell's views to be misrepresented, so that they appear to have a well-known politician espousing their views. 
 As Daniel Hannan said, after being smeared with accusations of racism after agreeing with Powell on some issue, """"I’m surprised that no one has picked up on the thing that I most admire about Enoch Powell, namely his tendency to ignore conventional wisdom and think things through from first principles.

 == Anarchism and how long could it exist == 

 Well I was thinking about anarchism this day and I've bumped into a problem: 

 1.) Anarchism from a Capitalist State 

 If there's a goodly working Capitalist Democracy, and then through a revolution it turns into Anarchism(wich is the abolishment of every law and governmental oppression) Companies would surely take the power because only they have enough money for weapons. So Anarchism will become """"Capitalism Liber"""" wich isn't really better than the original government, because they could even kill the residents if they want to. 

 2.) Anarchism from a Communist State 

 Yes, I've already philosophised about how anarchism created from a socialist society would work(nearly everything is controlled by state and there's strict authority) then it would turn out like this: New groups would form and there would be a bloody competition for previously state-controlled facilities and they will taxatate the use of them so it's basically the same """"Capitalism Liber"""". 

 3.) So how anarchism could be stable? 

 Well, I think that the strongest bond that could hold the people together in the state of absolute freedom is Religion. Maybe if there would be a religion wich STRICTLY OPPOSES CAPITALISM, and MONEY Anarchism could be maintained by the followers of that religion. And if there would be an ORGANIZED MILITARY just for DEFENCE, than this would hold people together also and defend from invasions, and it won't destroy the ABSOLUTLY FREE STATE OF SOCIETY. 

 What do You think about my opinion? I would gladly go into a philosophical argument.;)

Hoffman (Popular Aviation, March 1935, pp 163 and 196), and also one of the Fauvel flying wings, the AV-10; in YouTube, connected to the Arup airplanes films, some other low aspect ratio inverted-delta like wings appear. There was another example of circular wing, similar to the Coleoptere but of an ordinary width proposed in a hobbyists' magazine to be built as toy, but I'm not currently able to retrieve the image and plans. The Burnelli lifting fuselages can be considered another type of wing?",0

And both has been heavily criticized by proponent on the issue of validity and practices by those who believe that Nikah is the only legitimate form of marriage.” With this sentence you can start with an indepth look at why people are rejecting all the alternates to Nikah. The follow-up to this would be to answer the criticism and explain the point of views from the supporters of Misyar and Muta. I will be back to answer questions and elaborate on this idea.

"""1.This test uses a boring machine to present soil strength as N-value by driving a sampler into the ground for 30cm by blows from a slide hammer, and N-value resolution is per 1m so data only represents 30% of entire depth.  
 's Comment: is not actually a problem with the test, but with the method used in Japan to report the test results. In the U.S., one N-value isn't taken to represent a full one-meter interval, but only the 30 cm (or shorter) interval over which the sampler was driven. 
 's comment: I understand. This only applies to Japan, and the US civil industry analyze the ground consecutively, but the source also points out the interval is not always 30cm. This seems to be true in the US as well. And instead of deleting, one could point out this as the problem of the Japanese civil industry.  

 2. Measured data are neither linear scaling nor normal distribution, but logarithmic normal distribution. 
 's Comment: doesn't actually mean anything - there's a difference between a """"scaling"""" and a """"distribution"""".  
 : Soil strength is very wide ranged from the N-value zero to super hard rock, and if the researchers would like to be able to analyze the wide range of data, the scale needs to be exponential. 

 3. The method employees such a primitive method counting a number of blows of a slide hammer, it cannot collect accurate data for weak soil layers. 
 's Comment: The primitiveness of the method is not *why* it is inaccurate for weak soils. 
 's comment: The source does not use the term “primitive.” The source says “Problematic N-value zero.” But the hammer uses the accelerated force, and strong force tends to drive away everything.  
 One can tell that there is a great difference in how the force is applied to a matter using a sledgehammer pounding or using a drill and slowly squeezing out. The results are limited to whole numbers for a specific driving interval. This is very true, and the use of sledgehammer is the source of the problem. 
 In this 21st century or the high-tech century, is the use of sledgehammer and counting the blows the most sophisticated method to analyze the delicate and sensitive matter such as the ground?  This is why I used *primitive.* 

 From here is based on other document, but it does support my point. 
 Even if SPT N-value is consecutively measured, the sledgehammer drives in the sampler with acceleration. At the presence of gravels easily crackable by the boring machine, the N-value will be the average of the gravels and that location.  If the gravel is relatively strong, the blow will be consumed with the gravel's entire surface area so at the weak layer the entire surface area of the gravels will be measured, and the resulting N-value will be bigger even at the presence of the weak layer. 

 A sliding layer that would cause a landslide is a couple of centimeter thickness and slide with water so one cannot detect the sliding layers with the standard penetration method. 

 Recently there have been many landslides due to this reason; with the boring machine it is very hard to detect this sliding layers. Especially, the method cannot detect 0 to 3 N-value weak layers. 

 Some words could have been strong, but I do not believe they were wrong at all. 
 I believe the discussion is essential to improve everything. I welcome feedback. Thank you.

Not all of them are Turks, since Pomaks are NOT Turks, but some of them, I don't know how many, are. The official position of the Greek state, that this is only a religious minority has to be mentioned as well though, for completeness.  

 Having said all that, there is a very basic difference between Greeks in Turkey and Turks in Greece. After the pogroms of 1955 and the general ethnic cleansing policies of the Kemalist state, there are perhaps 1000 Greeks or less left in Turkey, most of them in Istanbul. The Greeks did NOT ethnic cleanse the Turks. Turks are perhaps a hundred times more and they occupy a large portion of two prefectures (Rhodopi and Xanthi). Greece, contrary to acquis communautaire and because of strict adherence to the Lausanne treaty, still lets the mufti perform lots of administrative and judicial duties. This, along with continuous propaganda from the Turkish state (the books in minority schools come directly from Turkey!), has made the minority a time-bomb inside Greece, waiting to explode.  """,0

 The sea-borne trade of the Ottoman Empire was predominantly in Greek hands: there were many Armenian, Turkish, Arab and Jewish merchants, but they kept to the land. In the late eighteenth century trade substantially increased, and Greek seafarers did well out of it. In the Aegean islands, especially Hydra and Chios, bigger and more modern ships were built, and shipbuilding and trading families made substantial fortunes. It is important to note that the Greek population was widely and thinly distributed within the Ottoman Empire, and that there were also Greek communities in foreign cities. In the peninsula and the Aegean islands the population was compactly Greek, though considerable numbers of Turks dwelt among them in some of the towns. Greeks formed large urban minorities in Constantinople, Alexandria, Bucharest, Iasi the ports of the lower Danube, and in the coastal cities of Asia Minor both in the Aegean and the Black Sea. There were also many Greek villages in the interior of Asia Minor. Outside the Ottoman Empire, the lonian islands had a mainly Greek population. They belonged to the republic of Venice until 1797. were then occupied in turn by French, Russians and British, and came into British possession by the Vienna peace settlement, Further a field, there were Greek merchant communities in Trieste, Venice, Vienna, Amsterdam and other West European cities. During the eighteenth century European education and ideas made themselves felt among a considerable part of the Greek people The Phanariot princes of Moldavia and Wallachia supported some excellent schools and collected libraries of European books. Knowledge of French was quite widespread at their courts. Constantinople also had good schools, and foreign languages were spoken and foreign literature read. Wealthy islanders founded schools from their trade and profits. Under Venetian rule the Ionian Islands offered Greeks the chance of education and access to Italian culture. Small but growing numbers of Greeks from the Ottoman Empire studied abroad, especially at Padua but also at Vienna, Leipzig and other German universities. Greek colonies in Western Europe helped the education of their compatriots both by inviting individuals to study in the West and by sending money to found and support schools on ottoman territory. 

 Increasing contact with the West introduced the ideas of the European Enlightenment to Greeks. This process was encouraged by many of the Phanariot rulers of Moldavia and Wallachia, but was disapproved by the patriarchate, although individual priests and even bishops favoured it. Natural science and rationalism were felt as a threat to Orthodox piety. Especially important was the cult of ancient Greece in European Enlightenment literature. Classical learning and thought were praised by the philosophers of the West as older than, and superior to. Christianity. Greeks in the West learned through this literature about their own past, which, if not entirely ignored, had at least been very little known to the intellectual elite of Constantinople either in the last period of the Byzantine empire or under Ottoman rule. The presentation to the educated Greek public of ancient Hellas, as seen through the eyes of French encyclopaedists and sentimental Western philhellenes, was above all the work of Adamantios Korais (174.8-1833). A native of Smyrna, who had spent six years in Amsterdam and six in Montpellier, and from 1788 until the end of his long life lived in Paris, Korais was an indefatigable author of translations, original works, articles and letters. He devoted himself to the propagation of the Enlightenment among the Greeks and of the Greek cause among the French, and above all to the development of a literary Modern Greek Language, to be formed by the infusion of classical words into the spoken tongue and by the systematisation of its formal structure. Korais took care not to attack religion or the Orthodox Church as such, but he fought bitterly against all customs, institutions and ideas which seemed to him to  
 be superstitious survivals from an age of darkness, preventing a return to a glorious past which would also embody in itself all the wisdom of new enlightened Europe. 
 The Orthodox hierarchy disliked this mixture of classics and rationalism, They too were becoming impatient of Ottoman rule as they saw it declining, they too were becoming affected by a new pride in being Greeks. But if the Ottoman empire were to be destroyed (and this did not seem imminent, nor did it seem wise to take big risks on so distant a prospect), they hoped that it would be replaced by something like the old Byzantine empire, based on autocracy and Ortho",0

I have also seen the pages updated by inserting the winners of the last three editions and the list of multiple medalists. It is not my intention to create items for other sailing classes. So I would say leave things as they are, in any case is never convenient to have pages too long. Otherwise we can discuss it in the Community Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Sailing. And now, whats your opinion on this request? Kasper2006 (talk)  

 :: I am not sure about this bearing inmind if you look at the old Olympic Classes like the Dragon (keelboat) and Flying Dutchman (dinghy) you will notice they don't have there own page and contain far more information. My own view is I would rather have a slightly longer page that is maintained than the data in lots of places. That old Sailing World Champion page is an example of this and probably something you hadn't even noticed I didn't until after about a year of editing sailing content. On a minor note it is a World Championship without the """"s"""" because your showing one title. This brings me on to my next concern the Finn also has a Junior Worlds and a Masters Worlds so your medal table is actually wrong Lawrence Lemieux from Canada I believe has won 5 masters title but I would need to check the Laser has even more titles!

 == Semi-protected edit request on 15 August 2015 == 

  

  
 Please excise from the Preamble heading the paragraphs I've reproduced below, in which the text of the Preamble is dissected, needlessly, and made subject to a myriad of specious editorial claims that are not and will never be substantiable, no matter how many sources one tacks on after the period. The text of the Constitution is the text of the Constitution. To assume that """"a more perfect union"""" refers back to the government under the Articles of Confederation is to take a liberty that the context doesn't allow. The phrase may be referencing England or France or the Ottoman Empire. It may be an expression of the founder's desire to create a union more perfect than all the unions that have come before and all the unions that have yet to come. Unfortunately, the Constitution doesn't explain what exactly it means by """"a more perfect union"""" and as a result neither can we. In addition to being groundless, the analysis is riddled with nonsense terms, such as """"the powers of the earth,"""" """"social contract of democratic philosophy,"""" and """"things of a general welfare."""" The final sentence of the second paragraph is plainly incoherent.  

 Ultimately, my request is that the paragraphs at issue be deleted and replaced with the text of the Preamble verbatim. 

 -""""One people"""" dissolved their connection with another, and assumed among the powers of the earth, a sovereign nation-state. The scope of the Constitution is twofold. First, """"to form a more perfect Union"""" than had previously existed in the """"perpetual Union"""" of the Articles of Confederation. Second, to """"secure the blessings of liberty"""", which were to be enjoyed by not only the first generation, but for all who came after, """"our posterity"""".[27] 

 It is an itemized social contract of democratic philosophy. It details how the more perfect union was to be carried out between the national government and the people. The people are to be provided justice, civil peace, common defense, those things of a general welfare that they could not provide themselves, and freedom. A government of """"liberty and union, now and forever"""", unfolds when """"We"""" begin and establish this Constitution.

 ::Given that I filed the most recent DRN about this issue - and at the risk of incurring the wrath of all the editors who have taken part in previous iterations of the dispute - may I say that I too was slightly surprised at the speed with which it was closed. I think that the conclusion that  stated was largely inevitable and I agree with it; but, I for one would have welcomed a closer focus on what I saw as the central flaw in CartoonDiablo's table, since I believe that that flaw goes to much more profound questions of epistemology than were addressed in the debates, namely: 1) the proper status and interpretation of meta-analyses, and 2) the interpretation of 'absence of evidence'.  
 ::While not having any great formal expertise on these issues (which is why I did suggest obtaining an opinion from someone with expertise in scientific research in general, rather than from someone within the clinical sphere, who would, apparently, likely have some bias one way or another in the CBT vs psychodynamic wars), can I say - for what it's worth - that I think that CartoonDiablo fell into error on a couple of fundamental points: Firstly, he greatly over-rated the significance of meta-analyses generally, apparently believing that quantity of studies included in the meta-analysis was in itself a measure of merit, whereas in fact the particular methodology used is very significant, and systematic error and bias are not always easily discernible in such studies: the article on Meta-analysis describes some of these disadvantages and weaknesses. 
 ::Secondly, he interpreted the 'holes/absences/silences' in the French study as grounds for making a positive assertion, ie, """"No effect"""". This is an error and a fundamental problem in epistemology: Argument from ignorance#Distinguishing absence of evidence from evidence of absence|Distinguishing absence of evidence from evidence of absence''. 
 ::Given that the logical conclusion flowing from the sum total of disputes about this issue would appear to be that there are strong grounds for removal of the table from all of the articles, I would have liked to have seen a bit more thorough analysis and discussion on the specific points I raised. I'm not necessarily asking for the dispute to be reopened, but I think it could have been concluded a bit more satisfactorily.   """,0

 Somehow I thought that """"shields"""" meant a protective coating like lacquer over the painting, like glass in a picture frame. You meant a military shield used in combat - like Aragorn in Lord of the Rings, knights in shining armor trying to slice or skewer each other with swords. 

 Maybe re-casting this sentence from the passive voice? Like: 

 *Knights decorated their shields with oil painting - instead of tempura - because . . .

"== ==Don’t Drain Wikipedia== == 

 Six months ago I anchored myself into Wikipedia history as the sole creator of the Ernest Scared Stupid article. It was my little niche in the World Wide Web, a place I could retreat to and acknowledge as my contribution to Planet Earth. 

 My happy little world was shattered a couple days ago when I made a daily visit to Wikipedia only to discover your modifications. The Ernest Scared Stupid article had been edited by other users in the past, and often to my disliking, but never to the degree that would warrant me trying to reform the changes made and eventually writing a letter voicing my disappointment. 

 You seem to have re-formatted every Ernest movie article in a very generic, formulaic format. All of “your articles” are bound by a bland sense of rule-following: Title, year, genre, star, director, plot, MPAA rating (and followed by) Cast, Plot, and Trivia. To your extensive editing I have the following to say: This is Wikipedia, not IMDB. 

 I don’t mind you adding facts such as MPAA rating, cast, etc. But do you have to do so in an ugly, database format? Believe it or not, each article of an encyclopedia (and especially a wiki encyclopedia) is unique and has artistic merit largely due to the fact that the articles are written by a diverse range of people and do not conform to one another. For example, the article on Guyana is formatted similar to, but not the same as, the article on Suriname. The photographs are not in the exact same spots and the Content Boxes are not identical. Would the Ernest films be so great if they were all bound by the same exact plot structure? 

 So congratulations, you have edited every single Ernest movie article. Any casual research on any Ernest film will feature ideas and information provided by a high school student from Connecticut (this fact is used merely to point out the narrowness of the source, not to discredit your age or location.) I seriously feel you are turning Wikipedia into a dull, Communist-style building complex. Ten gray buildings resting side by side, 24 rooms each, 48 windows, etc. Spice things up.",0

 ::: I am not arguing that Hednesford isn't a distinct town. I am arguing that we don't need an article on the Cannock built-up area (all it does is state what is in it and it's population) and hence redirecting it to this article and that this article could do with stating that Cannock is the largest part of a built-up area which includes Hednesford and Great Wyrley as well as some smaller settlements. You probably shouldn't have removed the merger notices because they are up to try and attempt to get more people discuss this which is the point of them. 
 We only really need one line in this article to summarise the Cannock built-up area and what it contains. This is what I wrote previously

 == Wikipedia Reference desks == 

 Hello Aspro. On 11 July you replied to a question asked at Wikipedia:Reference desk/Science. The question related to Airliner cabin air. See your diff. Your answer included the following statements: 

 :The banning of smoking also meant that the amount new air added to the cabin could be reduced -thus saving the costs of pressurizing greater amounts of air to keep the interior atmosphere agreeable. To save more costs, they also reduced (in the last decade), the cabin pressure – but to the detriment of passengers suffering from emphysema and other medical conditions that low air pressure can aggravate. To counter the possible resulting in-flight emergencies from this new practice, some air-lines are now carrying portable automatic heart defibrillators on board. 

 To support your answers you supplied a link to a website that discusses spraying of insecticides on airliners. I have looked at that website but found nothing to support the statements I have pasted above. 

 I have also looked at the Wikipedia article on Cabin pressurization but I found no information of the kind you gave in your answer. It looks to me like you have used the opportunity given by this question to respond with some of  your original research. It looks to me very much like your own conspiracy theory, or someone else’s conspiracy theory to which you have enthusiastically subscribed. 

 Wikipedia’s reference desks are intended as places where Users from around the world can ask serious questions and receive high-quality answers. I think your answer was a very poor one so I ask that, in future, if you can’t find the answer using the resources of Wikipedia or some other reliable published source, don’t answer the question. Certainly don’t use the reference desks as vehicles for your own original research or your favourite conspiracy theory. Before I write anything more I am interested in whatever comment you wish to make about my criticism.  '''' """,0

 == Darn good question == 

 I used the 88k for a """"high-powered"""" embedded system in the late 80s and I thought it was a really nice CPU, easy to design with, program for and easy to get good performance with minimal tweaking. At the time it had some very advanced concepts which made efficient pipelining a snap. 

 However, the multi-chip design of the 88100 (needed two MMUs and one CPU; remember, split I/D buses!) was a big turn-off in general, initial performance was disappointing, the separate MMU chips slowed things down even more, and it wasn't cheap. The 88110 was a major improvement in both speed and ease of use, but they were always behind in the CPU clock speed wars... and wasn't long after that PowerPC was announced. Combined with Sun's heroic efforts to spread the gospel of SPARC, the chip was doomed. A shame, but I think the answer is that just came out at exactly the wrong time. If the 88110 had been released in the late 80s, it probably would've caught on. 

 I believe Ford (yeah, the car people) also used it in a graphics workstation, but I may be misremembering. The 88k actually had special instructions for doing Gouraud shading calculations.""",0

"Admiral Richard E. Byrd and the polar regions 

 It is not possible to know the history of the polar regions or undertake scientific investigation of the areas without being aware of Admiral Richard E. Byrd or benefitting from his contributions. As a navigational aviator, Byrd pioneered in the technology that would be the foundation for modern polar exploration and investigation. As a decorated and much celebrated hero, Byrd drew popular attention to areas of the world that would become focal points of scientific investigation in numerous disciplines. Finally, as a naval officer Admiral Byrd contributed to the role of government in sponsoring and facilitating research in polar regions and topics.  
 Richard E. Byrd first made his mark in the U.S. Navy. Graduating with the class of 1912 from the U.S. Naval Academy, he served in the battleship fleet until forced into medical retirement in 1916 from the after-effects of a smashed ankle suffered while a midshipman. Recalled to active duty in a retired status, he organized the Commission on Training Camps. In April 1918 he won his wings as Naval Aviator 608. 
 From the start of his flying career he demonstrated unusual ability. Byrd pioneered the technique of night-time landings of seaplanes on the ocean and flew out over the horizon, out of sight of land, and navigated back to his base. In 1918 he proposed flying the newly built NC-1 flying boats across the Atlantic to the war zone in France. His war service was in Canada as Commander, U.S. Naval Air Forces with responsibility for two air bases in Nova Scotia. 
 With the conclusion of hostilities, Byrd was called to Washington and made responsible for the navigational preparations for the transatlantic flight attempt of the NC flying boats in l9l9. He was a skilled officer in representing Navy interests under consideration by the Congress. Byrd won wide acclaim for directing the lobbying effort that resulted in the first post-war pay-raise for military personnel. Byrd was also invaluable in the long campaign of Naval aviators to establish a Bureau of Aeronautics. 
 Interested in polar exploration from childhood, his adult involvement began in 1924 when he was appointed navigator for the proposed transpolar flight of the Navy's dirigible Shenandoah from Alaska to Spitzbergen. When the flight was canceled by President Coolidge, Byrd began to organize his own Navy flight expedition to the Arctic. He was compelled to join forces with the MacMillan Expedition to northwest Greenland sponsored by the National Geographic Society in 1925. At that time Byrd completed the first flights over Ellsmere Island and the interior of Greenland. 
 In 1926 he took leave from the Navy to organize a privately financed expedition to the Arctic, which was to be based in Spitzbergen. Plans included several flights over the pack ice, including one to the North Pole. Supported by Edsel Ford, John D. Rockefeller, Jr., the New York Times and others, Byrd and his pilot, Floyd Bennett, claimed to have reached the North Pole on May 9, 1926. Both men were awarded the Medal of Honor after their return to the United States. In later years scholars have raised questions about the success of the expedition in flying over the North Pole. 
 Cheered by the outpouring of public support and admiration, Byrd continued his leave from the Navy. With commercial sponsorship, he completed the first multi-engine airplane crossing of the Atlantic to France. Byrd then turned his sights to Antarctica in 1928. During the remaining years of his life he was involved in five expeditions to Antarctica. These explorations accounted for the discovery of hundreds of thousands of square miles of territory which were claimed for the United States. He personified the inception of the mechanical era of Antarctic exploration. No other person in Antarctic history has contributed more to the geographic discovery of the continent than Byrd. 
 With highly visible accomplishments, he thrilled millions and raised large amounts of funding. He flew over the South Pole in November 1929. He spent most of the winter of 1934 alone in a meteorological hut some 100 miles into the interior. His winter weather observations were the first taken from the interior. This effort almost cost Byrd his life when he was poisoned by carbon monoxide fumes. 
 Byrd remained a promoter of Antarctic exploration. He merged his plans for a third private expedition with governmental plans and became the commanding officer of the United States Antarctic Service. With the onset of World War II he returned to active service and earned two decorations as the Chief of Naval Operations.  
 In the early post-war years, Byrd participated in the organization of the U.S. Navy Antarctic Developments Project in 1946-47 (Operation Highjump) He supervised the preparation of a study for the Joint Chiefs of Staff of Greenland as a site for military training and operatio",0

The user concerned has taken to using sockpuppets to further their POV, as is the case here.   
 :Thanks for the info. I certainly don't want to encourage a disruptive anonymous editor in an axe-grinding campaign. Nevertheless, as somebody with no interest in his or her campaign, I actually agree with the sentiment on this particular edit. I don't think it's valid to add Gaelic names for places which don't naturally have them, either in historic, or current social use of the language. That would be the province of the Gaelic edition of Wikipedia, not this English edition. I am in no way suggesting that Gala fits that description — I don't know if it does or doesn't — but that's the whole point of asking for a reference, isn't it? I think it would be within the spirit (and rules, I dare say) of Wikipedia to provide a reference showing that the name is really used, and not just a transliteration. Obviously, """"common sense"""" sometimes is what's called for, when there is no readily available reference, but on that note I'd add that I have a relative in Gala and have been a visitor to the town on many occasions, and can't recall ever seeing the Gaelic name on any signs, or hearing it used (for what little that's worth). 
 :In short, I'm more than happy to see these names if they're genuine, but find them to be a political campaign in and of themselves if they're made up by Gaelic speakers purely for these articles. –  ('''')  

 ==Chiswick warning notice== 
 Hi, Kierant. I am puzzled by the warning notice (for lack of references) you inserted in the notable people section of Chiswick. What exactly do you expect to see here? Are you saying that the fact of local residence should be referenced, or are you asking about the notability of the people? If the second, the references should be in the individuals’ articles. If the first, some have suitable references within their own articles – for example, the article on Anthony Burgess, the first name on the list, includes a note of his Chiswick residence. But I am sure this is not the case with all the names, and I am concerned about the amount of work needed if this point is to become general within all the similar sections in all the local area articles. Do you intend to insert your notice in each and every such article? None I have looked at so far have this particular type of reference – nor has anyone else inserted a warning notice for that reason. Yes, I know that a high standard of scholarship is required, but this must vary according to the importance of the fact in question; and the residence of all those notable folk is not of major importance. Don’t you think you have gone a bit over the top in this? I would like to see the notice removed, please.   

 :Hi. This list of notables is particularly long, and provides no background information at all, being just a list. These are prone to unsubstantiated edits. It is of course preposterous to expect every sentence in an article to carry a reference, but a list like this needs backup — in every article in which it appears. That's a fundamental part of Wikipedia (please refer to WP:ATT). It's not always necessary to insert a warning/contribution request tag if the list isn't getting out of hand or the information is known by common sense; but they tend to start to be somewhat regulated when they get long, as this one now hopefully has. Please compare with the discussion at Talk:Bow, London about the same issue. A good deal of excellent work has gone in to sourcing the data in that article for another area of the same city. –  ('''')  

 ::Thank you. The Bow reference is interesting, both for the approach to the list and for the passions aroused! I think that the main points to consider for Chiswick are: 
 ::# Each name on the list should have a line to itself, with a brief note of the reason for its inclusion. This allows you or someone else to add to each line a separate request for citation if needed, rather than a single whallop of a warning; it allows vandalism to be more easily spotted; and it is much easier to read and comprehend. This has been mentioned in the Chiswick discussion already, but the Bow discussion makes",0

Maybe you'll still attempt to say """"oh, but its not her fault still!"""", but that would perhaps mean something if she didnt use her control over him to force him to leave. 

 Oh, wait...not he loved her, I see, then that makes it aaaall better. Not her fault, Lennon loved her. Yeah, no.

 Dude, you need to slow down a bit. Hurling insults after each comment just makes it look like you're trolling. You don't seem to have that intention so I thought I should leave you a note rather than referring you to an admin for blocking or some such thing. Everyone is upset/on edge/whatever and calling people's suggestions """"bullshit"""" doesn't help.  

 People have proposed all sorts of crazy things for inclusion in that article and none of them are going to happen. But each has been considered and dismissed and the dismissal has been nicely explained, especially when the proposer is an IP who might never have edited here before. You're also new here, so surely you get that? 

 Responding to crazy stuff with well-reasoned argument will always have more of an impact that chucking out insults anyway. Yeah?  """,0

 Hi TFOWR, hope you don't mind me coming here and asking a question ~ you're a fairly new admin, so you probably remember what it's like not to be one of the all-knowing, and for quite a long time i've noticed you and figured your head was on straight.  I was looking through a conflict i was, regrettably, involved in about a year ago, and i notice that the talk page of the article has been archived, maybe to hide the disagreements that happened; i have no issue with that.  What does surprise me, however, is that the page was edited at some point prior to being archived, so that it no longer is a correct record of what happened.  To be specific, i can easily point to at least one of my comments that was completely removed here, and that isn't the only pruning done.  My question is, do i ignore this? reinsert the missing comments silently? reinsert them and add a note at the beginning of the archive? note that the archive is incomplete at its top?  I don't know, so i turn for your opinion.On a completely irrelevant side note, have you changed your sig recently?  It's seemed to be slightly more muted; i preferred the previous edition.

 == Jaffa Cinema advertisement Origin? == 

 Can anyone verify the time in which """"Jafa"""" or """"Jaffa"""" came into use and also where it originated from? I am under the belief (until proven otherwise) that the term emerged when advertisements at picture theaters (cinemas) starting showing advertisements for the """"Jaffa"""" chocolate confectionery before the screening of movies. This advertisement clip featured a picture of Auckland city after which a huge Jaffa is dropped down to squash part of the city coinciding with a farting sound effect. I believe this advertisement was circulated in picture theaters in Auckland (and perhaps also around the country?) in the early 1990's. I believe after this point Aucklanders became to be known as Jafas/Jaffas by non-Aucklanders and acronyms such as """"Just Another Fucking Aucklander"""" and/or """"Just Another Fuckwit From Auckland"""" came after this point. There is no mention of these things, especially the cinema advertisement, in this article.""",0

 :This is a common misconception. Remember, this is a wiki, and sentences may be moved, added to, and so on. Just few days ago I reviewed a DYK and asked the nom for an ref for the hook inside a para. The para first and last sentence had the same ref, and you'd think the middle, where the hook was from, would have the same one, right? But it was instead another source the nom used, but forgot to add to that para. This is just one of many cases which prove that it is better safe than sorry, and referencing each sentence is the right thing to do. For UZZ, imagine - what if somebody were to add new content to the middle of that para, with a reference - would you then assume that the beginning of that para is referenced with the new, middle-of-the para ref? Or split it into two, thus leaving the first one unreferenced? I hope you see now why each sentence has to have its own reference. Could you restore the refs you removed? Thank you, | """,0

 == Definition of lithosphere asthenosphere boundary == 

 """"Lithosphere"""" has the potential to become a really great article, but it is currently missing a few key topics. The article would benefit from discussions of the effective elastic thickness and how it relates to lithospheric thickness (Burov and Diament, 1995), rheological models of the lithosphere (i.e., yield strength envelopes)(Goetze and Evans, 1979), and the observation that the equation given for lithospheric thickness does not work for lithosphere older than ~80 Ma, possibly due to small-scale convection (Parsons and McKenzie, 1978). 

 However, I think this article would benefit most from a discussion of the different ways in which the base of the lithosphere is defined. Right now the article suggests that the base of the lithosphere is defined as the brittle-ductile transition (BDT) in olivine, following the mechanical-boundary layer definition of Parsons and McKenzie (1978). However, several other definitions exist including 1) the crust and portion of the mantle which mainly transports heat through conduction rather than convection (i.e., a thermal boundary layer), 2) a rheological boundary defined by compositional differences (e.g., water and/or melt content; this is becoming increasingly well received and should be mentioned), and 3) the seismically fast, elastically anisotropic lid (i.e., seismic lithosphere). An excellent review is given by Fischer et al. (Annual Reviews of Earth and Planetary Sciences, 2010). 

 Although the definition currently provided is worth mentioning, statements such as """"the lithosphere remains rigid for very long periods of geologic time in which it deforms elastically and through brittle failure"""" reflect the outdated perspective of the article as written.""",0

 I see that phenomics is also now redirected to phenotype.  This is an even bigger stretch, I think.  According to Wikipedia, """"Synonyms are different words with identical or very similar meanings"""".

 Since you are a Portuguese masquerading under an Icelandic identity, your accusation of """"vandalism"""" rings distinctly hollow.  It is not I who is seeking to undermine the integrity of English Wikipedia, but you.

 (1) This is an article about the Autonomous Community of Galicia, a political entity within Spain. 

 (2) The official name of this entity in BOTH Spanish AND Galician is """"Galicia"""", not """"Galiza"""".  As the text further down makes clear, the term """"Galiza"""" (identical to the name of the region in Portuguese) is championed by sectors of Galician nationalism who abhor anything or any term which smacks of """"Spanishness"""". 

 (3) The version of the article you are seeking to peddle is misleading by virtue of giving the impression that the spelling """"Galiza"""" enjoys some sort of co-official status with """"Galicia"""".  It does not. 

 I do not know whether you are simply ignorant of the true position, or disingenuously giving vent to some anti-Spanish cum Galician nationalist agenda of your own.

 == Here are 10 great tips for building any loving relationship == 

 There are numerous love stories out there that it would take a long time to very long time to tell them all 

 As common as the word can be, Love is one of the most difficult feelings to explain. There are numerous love stories out there that it would take a long time to very long time to tell them all. But these started from somewhere, by building their own love so others can be inspired to fall in love too. 

 There are some basic things to learn about loving relationships and every action or inaction counts. 

 Dr. Lynda Klau of YourTango puts together a list of what a loving relationship should really be like: 

 Create a safe environment for sharing: Don't interrupt, even if you need to put your hand over your mouth to stop yourself. Learn to fight fairly. No name calling. Don't make threats. Apologize when you know you should. If you're too angry to really listen, stop! Go into another room, take space for yourself, breathe, and """"calm down."""" Remember: your partner is not the enemy.

 im not believing lebron is 6f9 250 unless i actually see him on some scales. if lebron james is 250 lbs then earl boykins is 6ft 180 lbs. i could tell you right now that im 7ft 250lbs and that doesnt mean that its true. ben wallace is about 6ft7 250 lbs but looks bigger than lebron  —Preceding unsigned comment added by     

 I looked to see if I could find a reliable source for the 6'9"""" height.  I could not find one other than the one already provided, but did find some that say 6'8"""" 
 :6’8” 250 lbs,  
 :6’8” 240 lbs,  
 :6’8” 245 lbs,  
 :6’8”,  
    

 ::What source is more reliable than LeBron James' own words? He said """"I'm 6-9 and 260"""". This is as clear as it gets. Does he have to spell it for you to realize it?    

 :::Right...because nobody has ever lied about their height before  I don't really care how tall he actually is. Verifiability, not truth. James is a primary source. Wikipedia articles should rely on reliable, published secondary sources.   
 ::::I actually don't see a reason why James should lie about his height or weight. It's not like Joe Pesci saying he's 7 ft. tall. James actually is big, and whether the public believes he is 6-8 or 6-9 should make no difference to him. I think he's telling the truth. And further, it's not like it is totally unrealistic that someone grows an inch between his 18th and 22nd birthday.  

 :Unfortunately James' own words do not mean it's the most reliable information, particularly insofar as the policies of this encyclopedia are concerned. Perhaps rather than stating it in the body, you can state it in the footnote (as a form of """"however"""") that James himself says he is 6'9.    

 :::From WP:Sources, Articles should rely on reliable, third-party published sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy.  Lebron James is a primary source.  All the sources above are third-party sources and at least some of them have a reputation for fact checking and accuracy.  The Wikipedia policy prefers third-party sources over primary sources if available.  So based on that, the BBC  is a more reliable source according to the policy than Lebron James himself.     

 ::::Any of you every studied history to know what the difference between primary and secondary sources is? I doubt it. 
 ::::I find it curious to think of NBA.com, ESPN, or RealGM as """"reliable, third-party published sources"""", because none of them ever measured or weighed LeBron James. The NBA weighed him once, at the 2003 NBA Predraft camp. He was 6-8 240 back then. That's it. Now LeBron James himself'', not some biased fan or whoever, says he has grown to 6-9 and gained 20 pounds since high school. Why is this so hard to believe?

 == Request for Advice - """"wisdom"""" == 

 This is a really important topic. The major problem is the word """"wisdom""""(""""Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast""""). 

 Wisdom is a big word, in fact many types of thoughts and ideas can be called """"wisdom"""". Since """"wisdom"""" is such a big word, almost anything can be used to interpret. 

 That's the problem. However, I found """"wisdom"""" explained in Book of Revelation, and that's what I'm trying to add to this Wikipedia article:

 :Hi - I reverted you before I saw this. Thanks for asking your advice. Basically, we shouldn't simply be taking quotes from the Bible and using them in this way, but should be finding sources meeting our criteria at WP:RS and using what they say about the biblical source.

 ::Wikipedia is not a primary source.  We do not simply reprint primary sources without explanation.  We're not a secondary source either (but a tertiary one), so that explanation must come from another secondary or tertiary source.     
 ::REPLY: Thanks. Understood. 

 Sigh, what I'm trying to do, is to alert people about 666. I take this so seriously, because I'm Dieyu(check dieyu.org to see what it means). In fact, I have """"wisdom"""". I'm going to add some really serious content to this """"talk"""" page - it's """"original research"""", meanwhile, it's the truth. I hope it won't be deleted. It's the truth of this topic. (I respect Wikipedia and won't add """"original research"""" to the main article. I only add this to """"talk"""" page, which is allowed here as far as I observed ...) 

 First, in the context of Book of Revelation, """"wisdom"""" is never about number of a name ... Since """"wisdom"""" is a super big word, almost anything can be used to interpret - God wouldn't allow any misunderstanding, so """"wisdom"""" is in fact explained in Book of Revelation: 

 Bible said, """"where the whore sat, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues"""". 

 Bible said, """"a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns"""". 

 Bible said, """"And here is the mind which hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sat."""" 

 Bible said, """"And the ten horns which thou saw are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast."""" 

 Summary: 

 """"woman sit"""" - """"peoples"""" / """"beast"""" - """"seven mountains"""" and """"ten horns"""" - """"wisdom"""" 

 The only possible answer is that human has """"seven mountains"""" and """"ten horns"""". And the only reasonable interpretation is that """"seven mountains"""" are two eyes, two ears, two nostrils, and a mouth; """"ten horns"""" are human hands - this is where to count in the context of """"wisdom"""" in Book of Revelation. This is it.

 == Incorrect term used AGAIN == 

 Forgive the capitalisation, but it now seems as if Wikipedia's being lax. Almost every single time there's an article making mention of something to do with England, it's referred to as Great Britain, or the United Kingdom. Even if one considered this dubiously fine, it's usually being done before 1707, and the union between England and Scotland. 

 Today's article on the main page referring to the burning of the palace of Whitehall says """"English Monarchy,"""" and links to the British Monarchy page! The British Monarchy won't even exist for another   nine years from that date of destruction! 

 I feel like I'm posting the same thing every single time. If it's before 1603, the it's England and Scotland seperately (Obviously not the War of the Three Kingdoms period under Cromwell's forced unification).If it's after 1603 but before 1707 then It's England and Scotland under one crown. If it's after 1707 then England and Scotland together are the Kingdom of Great Britain.  

 With all due respect, it's beginning to seem like some individuals know fully well what they should be writing, but don't.

 === WHO GAVE YOU A RIGHT TO REMOVE THE POV TAG!!!? === 

 First, De Administrando Imperio is an anachronistic source preserved in different, contradicting, editions. Second, what precise """"Dalmatia"""" they were referring to? The notion of """"Dalmatia"""" changed a lot during history. Until it stuck to what it is now, about 300 years ago, the Europe regarded basically the whole Western Balkans as """"Dalmatia"""". Did the medieval authors refer to the administrative unit inside its precise borders at the specific moment (what moment?) or to the entire region that was commonly known as """"Dalmatia""""? Did the term refer to both Dalmatia inferior and Dalmatia superior (in which case it would comprise not only Dioclea, but, most of Rascia too)? Moreover, the fact they spoke about """"Serbs"""" (the same may apply to Croats too) doesn't explain who the Serbs actually were. The people? A people? One of the peoples in the area? A military class? The people that provided most of the military class in the area? A dynasty? Even today, in France, for example, they tend to call anybody who looks a bit darker """"an Algerian"""". In Italy - """"Moroccan"""". They often call any foreign worker from East Europe """"Albanian"""", or """"Romanian"""", or """"Pole"""" etc. depending on what group has the major public exposition at the moment. If nowadays there is often such a little care to make a distinction among """"strange"""" peoples, let alone how much Romans or Franks bothered about it! That citation only shows that there has been in existence some source of power (although it's not very clear what extent of power) that both Franks and Romans called """"Serbs"""". And that was all they were interested in - who detains the power in the region. If they mention territories that, in certain moment, have been under rule of Serbian princes (either directly, or through subordinates), it doesn't imply they were inhabited by Serbs. It doesn't actually necessarily mean that, in that period, there have been any territories inhabited by Serbs at all, since we don't know what the term """"Serbs"""" really meant. If we suppose that some land (say - Rascia) had indeed been inhabited (in part, or completely) by a people called """"Serbs"""", and if a close relative of the Rascia's ruler ruled another land, it doesn't imply the another land had been inhabited by Serbs. Finally, if the source say the early Serbs """"ended at Neretva"""", it doesn't mean the entire Neretva was the border. It means - at some point, somewhere at Neretva. (Of course, Neretva may have been the border by its whole length, but, the source doesn't say so.) And even if it ended anywhere at Neretva, I really don't understand what would you like to prove with that citation. With only exception of the Delta and maybe the narrow strip by the river, Pagania was - on another side of Neretva! So, if they """"ended at Neretva"""", it would mean - they ended before Pagania. Just because the secondary sources are not authored by Serbs, it doesn't mean they are quality sources?   """,0

"Tvor65 - Excuse me? It's my fault you have to work late because you chose to pick a fight? I don't think so. I don't believe you have added a single section to either the IBDP article or this one. Truthkeeper and I were right in the middle of re-formatting what had been an almost blank page. Truthkeeper supplied two former versions of the page, the second of which I said had some information that was worthy of inclusion. No one bothered to include any of it. I had restored the IB Series Box and inserted the IB Mission Statement box. Truthkeeper eloquently condensed the WP:LEAD, and found it necessary to remove the Mission Statement Box for formatting purposes to be reinserted later. We reached agreement on the Programme thumbnail descriptions, the number of links to the Programme articles were effectively reorganized. I suggested a section on Director Generals and the Peterson Lecture series (the latter could be combined in the bio of Alec Peterson, the first IBDG) which I would have been able to help construct if you hadn't decided to launch your attack on the NGO/Controversy section. The section about the IB office locations needs to be expanded to reflect IB's announced change of locations in the near future. I suggested that part of the History from the IBDP article could be brought over to this article as well. More details about what IB Associations are would be helpful. I thought since LaMome had inserted the offices/associations sections, elaboration on those sections would have been his/her baby. Instead, this morning I read LaMome's snarky recap of yesterday's events. It's pretty difficult to keep reading a book when someone is beating you over the head.

 :Got your message.  Thanks for the note; as it happens, I have the Fairfield article on my watchlist, so I'd have seen your comments and edits anyhow.  (If you're not familiar with the watchlist, it's a good way to monitor pages for changes; you can add and remove pages from it manually, or you can set """"My preferences"""" so that every page you edit is automatically added to it.) 

 :And, while I'm dispensing advice: Notice how this comment is indented from the one above it.  That's done by putting a colon at the beginning of each paragraph (you can see it in this case if you switch into edit mode).  Additional colons produce additional indentation, and that makes it easier to keep track of who's saying what in a talk-page discussion.  (I've edited the talk page for Fairfield to indent your response from my original comment; if I add something further, I'll put two colons in front of it to indent it even further.) 

 :Now, to your remarks re. the Fairfield photos.  I'm afraid I have to chide you a bit on your assumption that I was vandalizing the article.  One of the core tenets of Wikipedia is """"Assume good faith"""".  Of course, there are situations that're clearly vandalism, but if there's any room for doubt, WP:FAITH.  That goes double if the editor in question has a record of non-vandalism.  If you'd checked my user contributions (click on """"Ammodramus"""", then find """"User contributions"""" under """"Toolbox"""" at left), you'd have seen that I've contributed a great deal of non-vandalizing content to articles on Nebraska, including adding photos to the articles on several hundred Nebraska towns.  Moreover, from my first reversion of your edit, I added an edit summary, which isn't the usual practice among vandals.  When I saw your removal of the photo without an edit summary, I was inclined to suspect vandalism on your part; however, when I checked your user contributions, I saw that you'd made useful contributions in the past, so were probably not engaging in deliberate vandalism this time. 

 :I have to disagree with """"it is not good etiquette to remove someone else's photo and replace it with your own. ADDING a photo to the page is one thing, but removing my photo was inappropriate. In the future, please refrain from removing other people's images from Wikipedia entries.""""  From the standpoint of Wikietiquette, changing or removing a photo is no different than changing or removing text.  As with text edits, one should add an edit summary, and the change is of course subject to discussion, reversion, further changes, etc.; but there's no presumption that the original photo is necessarily the best one. 

 :I'll justify my photo change at the article's talk page.  Thanks again for the note letting me know about your comment there.  I hope you don't mind my offering you advice; my hope was to help and encourage you, since we need more editors working on Nebraska, especially outstate Nebraska, subjects.

 == My thoughts == 

  asked me to check out this page to get my thoughts on it's status and potential future FA status. I promised a """"mini-peer review"""" so here are some of my thoughts: 

 *There are many sections throughout the article regarding his family. I realize that it moves chronlogically throughout the Senator's life, but instead of placing the sections convolutedly throughout, why not combine them into a general """"Marriage and family"""" section? Instead of """"Naval training, early assignments, first marriage, and children"""", it could simply become """"Naval training and early assignments"""" getting rid of the longer title (the same goes for """"Senate liaison and second marriage"""", """"US Congressman and more children"""", etc.) while moving the paragraphs having to do with his first marriage and children into the Marriage and family section. It should probably go below the """"Naval traning and early assignments"""" section. 

 *Consistent citation formats, including: 
 **for book sources; either cite them all individually in the text with page numbers, or place them all in a bottom """"References"""" section and write """"Smith, Anna (1989), p.0"""" in the footnote. 
 **italicize newspaper names; Something that I learned from my friend Wasted Time R. Either use the """"publisher"""" parameter in the  template and add two apostrophe marks at the beginning and end, or simply use cite news' """"work"""" parameter, which italicizes it for you. For works by other sources that have been republished, you will have to use both parameters. 
 **wikilinks; either link all the publisher names, link them only the first time they appear, or don't link any at all; authors with wiki articles may be wikilinked. 
 **no blogs! I removed one, and have seen a few others remaining on the page. Blog sources are not always verifiable. 

 *Citations needed: 
 **In the entire """"Keating five"""" section 
 **The mention of the """"Gang of 14"""" needs a citation as well 
 **McCain's attempts at immigration reform 
 **""""Cultural and political image"""" section 
 **The """"Military"""" section in """"Awards, honors, and decorations"""" 

 *Are there any free photos of the 2000 presidential campaign? If so, it would be nice to include one. 

 *In the """"Second Bush term"""" section, the quote """"Although Bush had threatened to veto the bill if McCain's language was included,"""" is strange. McCain speaks English, as we all know, and unless it's profanity or something else being reffered to, I'm not sure what """"language"""" the sentence is talking about. 

 *Above the """"Cultural and political image"""" section, there is one big list of ratings different organizations have given McCain over the years. Those aren't his political positions; it's a list that goes on far too long and does not communicate as much as should be communicated (particularly under the """"special interests groups"""" section). While I think one or two of the views expressed by the special interest groups and the political organizations should be kept, this section needs to describe McCain's Republican stance (moderate, conservative, or liberal) and views on the pressing issues of today (War on Terror, War in Iraq, War in Afghanistan, climate change, gay rights, illegal immigration, economy including taxes, healthcare, abortion, stem-cell research, etc.). I realize that much of those have been brought up in the article, but they should be made reference to here again because that is the title of the section. 

 *Get rid of the see also section and the template because it is the same one as that below the infobox. 

 *I've made my opposition to elecoral histories sections clear, but I am in no position to demand that this one be removed. I do, however, recommend that the format of the content stay consistent; two elections are horozontally listed with a scrollbar and colors, while one is vertically listed (I would prefer them all vertically listed). 

 All in all, I think this article has great potential and definitely FA worthy when the concerns I've raised are taken care of. Your biggest challenge, however (and boy do I know about FA challenges), is the stablity issue because he is currently running for office; I think that can be argued against by the fact that Barack Obama's article is featured and he too is running for president. I hope the editors have found this insight useful, and please if you have any questions feel free to contact me. Thanks so much and good luck,   """,0

If it is relevant and integral to the article, in it should go, but as far as I can make out, it is not integral to this article, but to the fraccing issue in general. As such it should go into fraccing articles, and though it might well rate a mention in this article, all such a mention should comprise is that there are concerns and controversies on fraccing safety and desirability, with links to the most relevant fraccing articles. If you think that those articles do not mention the drinking water issues in sufficient detail and balance, go to the fraccing articles to make up the deficiency, not here. Otherwise we finally wind up with a separate (and very likely conflicting) fraccing discussion in every drinking water article for every major community in the Eastern US. And each of those will need its own updating and reconciliation etc. In short: a mess. Mention fraccing by all means. But do not explain, argue or enlarge at all in this article.  If you want to expound, feel welcome, but do it in articles where it will be appreciated. The principle has nothing to do with fraccing as such; it has to do with decent construction of articles.

"== Amy Adams == 

 I'm sorry it cost you time and editing, but please stop going into good articles and start editing. You've not been here long enough to know the actual work that has already gone into articles like this and your edits are not progressive. I spent a great deal of time updating the filmography table to the present format used and added in the awards confirmed for Adams. You undid the formatting of the table for some reason. Since you did all of the additions in one huge edit, it isn't possible to sort out what edits might be considered valid and what is not. From the start of the article, you added the marriage template, which is not valid for a domestic partnership, you changed and added section titles with no support from article editors who worked this up to the good article status, you changed corrections to formatting for short films, I have no clue what you've done to the listings in the table, but one time minor appearances in some TV shows are no reason to disrupt it this way. I am right, take it to the talk page and stop reverting me. I reverted for a reason, not just because I want to do so. Take it to the article talk page. Period.",0

I like wikipedia because it provides me with an excellent opportunity to tell those who are right that they are wrong something I was never able to do with my father especially when he used to tell me that I would grow up to be nothing but a ugly, whiny, pillow biting, dick licking sycophant.

"Split  

  
 I started to look through the main article and got lost in the History section! Not that it isn't an impressive effort in pulling all that information together, but the article is pretty unwieldy. As such, I thought I'd be bold and try to split off the History section into its own article. 

 There are a few things that I know are tricky, and will need someone with more knowledge to look at: 
 * I don't know which of the References and External Links relate to only the History section, so I have left all of them in the main article, and pulled almost all of them across into the subarticle as well. 
 * The latter subsections of History, namely Base Railroad, Previous Names, Major Commands to which assigned, Major units assigned, and Eglin Auxiliary fields: it wasn't clear which side of the split these should be, since although all of them contain some historical elements, they don't fit into the chronological style of the rest of the History section, and some parts of them relate to the present day status of the base. 
 * Although I've added the Main article: link, I haven't attempted a summary of the split text, so it just goes straight into the Railroad subsection. Ideally this would have a couple of paragraphs summarising the thousands of words I split off! 
 * I did a short contextual intro to the new article, mostly from the existing intro on the main article, but I'm sure this could be better. 

 I hope I haven't upset anyone by doing this, but I think it makes it easier for readers to navigate in this format.",0

 There still seems to be something missing in the article on the """"heat"""" topic, it states that """"IR light from the sun only accounts for 50% of the heating of the Earth, the rest is caused by visible light.""""  Doesn't some of the heat on the earth come from other forms of electromagnetic radiation from the sun other than visible light?   Or is the absorbtion rate for other non-visible electromagnetic waves that the sun produce just too low to count?   This should be clarified, since the article also stated that """"Light or electromagnetic waves of any frequency will heat surfaces which absorb it.""""

 Your interest in the link between th Horus Myth and the """"Christian Mythology"""" perhaps clouds your judgment. 

 I say this because most people who come to learn more about the link between Horus and Jesus, and who use terms like """"Christian Mythology"""" tend to simply want to cement their view about how Christianity originated from Earlier pagan myths and to flesh the idea out. This tends to especially be true of those who claim an interest. 

 I realise this isn't assuming good faith, but its difficult to when you've faced this sort of thing before. 

 The truth is, there is no link between Horus and Jesus. Everything you have heard in Zeitgeist about it, and later in Religulous, is based on rubbish, that is completely unsupported by actual primary sources. 

 If you go to your local library and read any book on Egyptian mythology they have, you will not find mention of the specific similarities, like the virgin Birth of Horus, or his Crucifixion. Nothing about it is mentioned in any mythology book you care to look at. These parallels are only found in books that draw a direct link between Jesus and Horus. In other words, Christ Myther books. Thats the only place you will find the similarities discussed. 

 You won't find it in anything else, from the popular works of Victoria Ions to Oxfords Egyptological volumes. Each and every damning similarity used to show the link simply vanishes into thin air when you compare the claims to the Myth of Horus as presented by Scholarly works. IT becomes a Phantom you pursue into the shadows that grow long and dark, but lack real substance. 

 This Phantom can be pursued even to the original sources themselves, and translations of all can be found if you look, most online as they are now public domain. Here even there is only emptiness to greet the claims. 

  The Parallels between Jesus and Horus simply do not exist. If you want to study the origins of Christianity, then study it from the writings of the Church Fathers, the Bible (Yes I know how dreadful, using the Bible to study the History of Christianity), and modern Scholars who are recognized in the fields. Not all of whom are Christians themselves, and none affording a place at the table for consideration of the Christ Myth idea in general, much less the parallels suggested by you for inclusion regarding how Jesus and Horus are similar. 

 The truth is, there is no link between Jesus and Horus, and the Parallels in Zeitgeist and Religulous, and The Christ Conspiracy, and The Pagan Christs, and others, are nonexistent when you do real studies. In fact, they originate with 19th century Poet and Theosophist Gerald Massey, himself not an Egyptologist, and whose ideas are rejected and ignored by real Egyptologists. 

 If you want to study the Origins of Christianity, as I said earlier, study it from real sources. If you want to study the links between Christianity and Horus, there is nothing to study.

So they can pick two, or one, or whatever they feel like when expressing it. But as they are mutually inclusive too, they only have to pick one to also pick the other. This explains why the data came out like it did. We can show what happened, but we can't make judgements (ie talk about """"sole"""" nationality).

 Friend, 

 Fa- rectification is not a """"practice""""... it is part of cultivation...The closest phrase I can find to it is the Hindu concept of  """"Dharma Punastaapana""""... The dharma/teachings (Fa) rectifies the practitioners own heart... eliminating all evil within and the evil within the cosmic space encompassed by his bodies( not the physical body).... evil doesnot mean """"evil people"""" ... there is ABSOLUTELY NO SUCH CONCEPT... EVIL refers to aggregates removed from the nature of the cosmos(zen shan ren) that control human thinking .... for instace ancient hindustani scriptures say... """"you may hate sin... but never hate the sinner""""... 

 See what Li Hongzhi says about homosexuality: 
 """"You are wantonly indulging your thoughts. Your thoughts, like the ones I just mentioned, are not actually you. The mentality that makes you homosexual was driven by postnatally-formed bad things. But you yourself were numbed by them and went along with them and wallowed in the mud. You need to find yourself again and stop doing those filthy things. Gods view them as filthy."""" 

 ...we see that homosexuality is strongly opposed in all traditions including gnosticism( see quote above from pistis sophia) and Buddist scriptures.. homosexuality is bad... doesnt mean homosexuals are!!!!!! ... hatred is bad.. doesnt mean who ever has felt hatred is!!! 

 ... all cultivation ways clearly distinguish between aggregates that manipualte human thoughts to make them accumulate karma and the person himself.... They also point out that some of the greatst cultivators have arisen from the sinnrs of the past... 

 .. we see that in the teachings, cultivators are asked.. never to harbour even the slightest trace of hatred against the police men who torture them in prison... not to see it with human thoughts... to see that they themselves are being manipulated by the """"evil""""...  

 ... The content you are trying to add is terribly inaccurate....

 Fra John. I have taken adequate time today to review the policies of wikipedia. 

 1) Verifiable statements are anything from reputable writings including media. They want us to write in our own words. We are not here to verify whether the article or work is true, but to use it as a basis to write an article. According to the policy, an individual needs sufficien verifiable facts to sustain a spot in Wikipedia. The only verifiable sources are those written against Schuckardt(media reports). Your reign of Mary or whatever it is you use is not sufficient because it is not accessable. You are in clear violation of this because your proof is insufficient and it adds unecessary fat to the article. 

 2) Personal attacks are those directed toward an individual. """"Schuckardt is the leader of a desstuctive cult,"""" is simply a statement not an attack. Most of the edits you make are not personal attacks but rather statements. Again you are in clear violation of this point. 

 3) This one I'll give you, this is not a personal forum, although, we express valid points that you consider personal attacks. And, you don't give straight answers. 

 4) NPOV or neutral point of view, deals with conflicting points of view. We clearly have this in the article. It also states that if someone is directly involved with an article subject, he or she SHOULD NOT CONTRIBUTE. The reason being is that they will be bias. You are directly involved with Schuckardt and you clearly state that you admire him as an individual. You are in violation of this policy. We are not because we have nothing to do with him and this article is only about him. 
 Don't preach to me about being in violation of wiki policy, because I see your bias in using wikipedia as a platform to push your group's point of view. The truth of the matter is that Schuckardt is a contoversial subject and the facts are this(for the last time):  
 1) He started a group in defiance of Vatican Council II 
 2) He received an illicit ordination and Consecration from the Old Catholic lineage 
 3) He imposed stringent rules on the faithful  
 4) He was using massive amounts of perscription drugs 
 5) He was denounced for being fanatical and for homosexuality 
 6) He fled Washington  
 7) He operated his organization in different States and settled in the Seattle area. 
 8) He continues to impose these fanaticle rules and control while being elusive 

 Fra these are not personal attacks, but the facts whether you agree or not. And I can provide the evidence. The Counterclaims section and Aryan Nations section have NO merit in the article and should be removed. You have yet to show me the evidence. As for what I have written, there are no personal attacks and if you remove one word you will be in violation.

 == This article needs major work! == 

 This entire article needs major work. The article on Maxwell's equations is excellent and is what I was expecting to find when I came to this article. However, I realize that it's pointless to duplicate all the material in the Maxwell's equations article and put it into this article. As a result, this article should be very short and serve mostly to redirect the reader to the Maxwell's equations article. However, the two items of classical electrodynamics that are not strictly part of the Maxwell's equations, the Lorenz force law and Newton's laws, should be mentioned in this article. Perhaps a list with very short descriptions of the concepts contained in classical electromagnetism belongs in this article, that then redirect the reader to other pages to learn more. The term """"classical electromagnetism"""" is a high level term that embodies a huge field of phenomena. As a result, I believe this article should have a high-level, descriptive tone (no equations) and then link to other pages heavily.   """,0

"Personal Information on your Userpage 	  
 Hi Jrae15vb. My name is Backslash Forwardslash. I am a Wikipedia administrator, and I noticed you have recently created a userpage. I don't intend to scare you away or attempt to intimidate you, but I thought you might want to reconsider some of the items on your userpage. You may have not realised that the items on your userpage release personal information about yourself (real name or age etc), which could be used against you in the future. While 99% of all the editors on Wikipedia are friendly, welcoming and harmless, there is a chance your personal information could be misused by editors not so 'high-minded'. A handful of editors have even felt real-world implications due to their Wikipedia edits and release of personal information.  

 Protecting your privacy, and remaining anonymous while on the internet — on any site — is a good idea. The internet is a worldwide and largely unregulated medium, and while Wikipedia is one of the safer sites, there are definite risks while online. With cyber-bullying and cyberstalking becoming increasingly commonplace, it is important that you take every precaution to remain safe. 

 I have deleted some revisions of your userpage in respect to your privacy for the time being, just in case you wish to reverse on your decision to have such content on public display. As a result, the information is only available to administrators. You are, of course, welcome to ask myself or another administrator to restore them, but I just wanted to make you aware of the risks involved with releasing personal information on such a public forum. If you wish to have the personal information removed so that even administrators cannot view it, I can request oversight on your behalf. You are also welcome to discuss this with me on , or privately via e-mail if you have any concerns. Again, I do not want to scare you. Wikipedia is a fantastic place with an incredibly supportive community. I'm just trying to ensure you are fully aware of the risks involved in editing, which are very similar to the risks you come across every day online. Hope to hear from you. \  /",0

 =the Army of Wiki-morons= 

 one is tired of the army of wiki morons. The nature of wikipedia is that, professionals usually refrain from contributing to the area of their expertise. Why? First of all, it would low down their status. A respected expert is not going to “contribute” to a avant-garde “encyclopedia”, for, they have written books and are paid to write. Writing for wiki certainly don't fit their professionalism.  

 But secondly, and most importantly, the motherfucking army of wikipedic morons is there to fight whatever insight or serious info professionals may contribute. These wiki morons, mostly consists of students, slackers, computing geeks... don't have fucking nothing to do everyday, and self-smug with a smattering of knowledge, think themselves as holder of justice et al, with full-fledged fucking wiki-rule this and npov that (and half of them openly have their OpenSource ideology to sell), will blow away or fuck up any expert's contribution in no time, even for subjects that are not controversial. 

 in a sense, this is unavoidable and a weakness of wikipedia, despite wikipedia's tremendous usefulness and the overall trust-worthyness. Wikipedia by itself is a massive of info, of which's utility and general benefit to human animals is far beyond any other commercial and professional encyclopedia out there can be. However, when it comes to deep academic subjects or when depth or seriousness are examed, wikipedia is a laughing stock. 

 I'm writing this for whoever may be reading my talk page. I do so despise the wikipedian fuckheads, though rather nameless.

If they continue (the more rapid the better in this case), request a short school block and you should find that admins may be more responsive.

"""::3D Platformers built on and borrowed from the 2D games on which they're based. And again, if you can find creators of later games crediting Banjo as an inspiration, then it IS relevant as influencial. However, if you can't find that, and the game in question didn't actually originate anything, I don't think the case is particularly strong. Banjo didn't do anything new, and no one has said they looked to it for inspiration, so it's kind of just baseless speculation.

 ::::Thanks for that answer, during which I was already typing. So firstly, to respond specifically to your last-but-one post above: 
 I mean the probability of choosing a goat or the car from the contestant's perspective. 
 I am distinguishing deliberately revealing a goat from other host behaviors because the contestant can infer the former (by the information that he knows what's behind the doors being superfluous if he is random) while the latter cannot be inferred from the information given. 
 Randomly revealing a goat would look no different, but the contestant has the information to infer it is not random on this occasion. 
 The Bayesian may calculate (not guess) 2/3, as the set of all possible unstated hindering variant behaviors and the set of helpful ones are equal in likelihood and opposite in value, thus neutral to the solution. Although I think the absence of any positive information means the assumption of 'no motive' is a safe one. 
 The frequentist answering the MHP question (ie 'In the circumstances stated in this scenario, is it to your advantage to switch?') would only count those games where the MHP circumstances apply, and their solution would approach 2/3.  
 As to the specific sources, making the same conditions is not the same as using the word 'always' - the precise conditions might only occur once in a series of similar games, or even once in all time, with the result on that occasion still 2/3. 
 I should emphasise that while variant scenarios may occur without affecting the MHP when it occurs, if variant host behavior can be discerned by the contestant a game meeting all the other conditions cannot be the MHP; as vos Savant put it """"Anything else is a different question"""". 
 Regarding your most recent post, I get basic conditional probability though am a novice in math and stats. The first time the MHP ever occurred the probability was 2/3. If it never occurred again, it was still 2/3. Now every time those conditions come together it's 2/3. If the host revealed the car on yesterday's show but you don't know why, it's 2/3 if the MHP comes together today. I am not disagreeing with the assumptions, or that they 'must' accompany the MHP, just with the word 'always'.  """,0

 Dear Muslim friend, thank you for your contribution. I feel the need to remind you though that any such experiment would constitute a primary source, which is not allowed in Wikipaedia: we work with secondary sources only... i.e. we work with science not with rumour. Now, having come to rumour, I have seen a pig toilet (in an Eastern European village) myself. Surprise surprise, the pigs did not eat the feces. If they did the owner wouldn't have been forced to clean up the thing weekly. I'm sorry to tell you but this is bollocks! 77.4 is completely right: that would be aomw recycling. And pigs would be the cheapest animals to raise... they would only eat their own feces: feed them once and it would be sufficient for a pig's lifetime. Only thinking at that would give you an inkling of an idea whether your assertions are true or false. 
 Now, as for the science of it, there are plenty of sources that detail what pigs do eat. Feces of any kind is not present in any of those studies. And that's the proof it's not happening. It's not happening under normal circumstances. Homo sapiens, under normal circumstances, does not eat flesh from other homo sapiens. Obviously there have been exceptions under the most unusual of circumstances (groups of people starving to death, cultural constructs etc.) but naturally it doesn't happen.    
 ::::::Dear 79.112.59.92, There is no reason for you to assume someone is Muslim. It is natural for pigs to eat human feces. It is not limited to Goa in India. You can go to any Indian village where pigs are present and see for yourself. Please refute my claim and I will give you 1 million U.S. Dollars. This is my challenge. It should be the same for any European village also. For how many days together did you observe the pigs? How many pigs did you observe? Are you 100% sure they did not eat feces? -

 :The following discussion is an archived discussion of a requested move. Please do not modify it. Subsequent comments should be made in a new section on the talk page. No further edits should be made to this section.  

 The result of the move request was: page not moved.    

  

 :Pig → Sus (genus) — Discussion of a request to merge Pig into Domestic pig found issues with the current arrangement of pages.  The article about the genus occupies the page name Pig and consequently attracts content about anything and everything to do with pigs, but other articles exist and the result is content forking.    

 * Pig (disambiguation) → Pig 

 *Oppose. People looking for """"pig"""" are very unlikely to know that they are really looking for """"Sus (genus)"""". There has to be a better way to solve the problem.

If they are running the page, they should better know that they can not destroy a contry by their shit negative advertising tactics. 
 Sri lankan tamils are now contry less people, and the world now know them as the official asian cleaners, who had migrated to Sri lanka, for cleaning work ( though they had been given equal rights and freedom they had misused it). And that their most brilliant terrorist(catholic) brains had created a black july and a civil war, just to create a reason for the SL tamils to migrate to the Europe and other countries (mostly to the UK and to Canada) as asylum seekers and to kill sinhalese budhists. The whole world inculding India is now aware of this. 
 And their 2nd phase of seeking more asylum seeker visas in other countries are the done using the last phase of the war (during 2009)by  LTTE using the tamil civilians as human sheilds in the battle field. and by creating an issue to the government by saying that the Army killed civilians by showing those images to the world. Though most know that those videos show the killings done by LTTE them selves. Even their picture of Black july ( in the Wikipedia page of Black July) shows Tamils only. the bullies around the naked man are nothing but tamils, and every one knows that. and  are done by LTTE them selves. The Sri lankan tamils are the 4th caste of India, so we are aware that they can do any wicked  & evil work  in the whole world.  
 Best thing for these tamils are leave sri lanka and to migrate back to where they belong, that's South India.There these tamils can fight for a seperate land, since India is big enough to ask for a seperate land. Then these tamils will have a peace of mind.

 Regardless, the picture of dolphin evolution is perfectly sensible. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that some land-based ancestor of hippos adapted to the sea and developed into the cetaceans. This population eventually diverged over a period of several million years (about 30 My for the branch that covers all river dolphins) into various genera, the four river dolphins amongst them.

 Hi D!  Happy Gobble Day!  Just stopping by with a quick """"hello!""""  (Hope *I* don't get in trouble for it too!  LOL)  Listen, I am 44 years old AND a professional writer AND I still get """"smacked"""" constantly by Wikipedians telling me I've done something wrong!  Sheesh!  (And, YES, I use CAPS for emphasis too  that's just HOW I talk!!!  Hey, and I'm a little deaf too, so maybe I'm yelling in real life and not just when typing too?!?  Oh well! -)  Anyhow, I am SOOO glad you are still """"with us"""" after SUCH a rough beginning - yow!  I read over your talk page and I learned a WHOLE LOT from that too!  I love that you are NOT AFRAID to ask questions, ever!  That's a VERY GOOD thing!  Don't let ANYONE take that away from you.  (It'll make you an awesome game designer too!)  I'm like that too.  And, it's NOT always an easy road to be on.  MANY people just give up and shut up and be quiet to avoid getting yelled at.  But, then we LOSE those people's creative new ideas that they might have had if they hadn't been to afraid to speak UP!!!  (Imagine what America would be like if Martin Luther King, Jr., had listened to all the people thousands! maybe millions! telling HIM to """"shut up"""" and """"go away""""!?!?) No! We NEED people like that, and like YOU!  So, hang in there, 'kay!?! 

 You know, I keep trying to communicate to various people (did the """"survey"""", etc.) about """"why"""" I think Wikipedia has been losing so many contributors. I might have to """"borrow"""" some of your quotes  I think you hit the nail on the head!  For some reason, when you're on the OUTSIDE it's really CLEAR how its messed up.  But, as soon as you try to """"explain"""" that to a Wikipedian, its gets confused and UNclear for some reason?!?!  Weird, I know, but that's the problem I have too! I felt like I could totally feel your frustration in trying to explain just that! I think, maybe, the """"hardcore"""" Wikipedians think that the Wikipedia ITSELF is more important that the PEOPLE who contribute to it.  I don't think that's true I think they have it BACKWARDS, cuz without the PEOPLE there'd be no one to MAKE the Wikipedia and no one to READ it or USE it either!!!  Bright, creative people (LIKE YOU!) are the very future of Wikipedia.  I think helping kids like you is MORE important than editting (for the 152nd time!) some article only three people have ever read!  Seriously! I think they're taking themselves TOO seriously. I wonder if that's the """"problem"""" with Wikipedia now?  It's TOO concerned with """"protecting the Wikipedia brand"""" so to speak?  Well, whatever.  I just had to decide for myself that I'd just do the best I can, shake off the harsh criticisms, try to learn from them as best I can and move on....

It looks like a good place to practice English, grammar, and learning Wikipedia skills.... (I still have trouble with my cites too. That info you have on your talk page REALLY helped me!)

"Cynicism really has no place here. In answer to your comment, If Malaysia announced plans for a lunar mission, I'd still report it.

It really is irrelevant what we feel about an article, as long as we report factually accurate information that is not misleading, yes? It is a fact that, based upon Thirkettle's comment, ESA intends to use Kliper for circumlunar missions. That's it, period. We know nothing about launchers they plan to use or not use, what funds they are allocating, or even how likely it is. The simple provenance of the source is good enough for me, which is not to say that is guaranteed to be true, as things change. Wondering how they'll fund it, what they'll launch it with or what missions they'll do is indeed pointless without evidence. We have an ESA top-man saying that Kliper will be used for independent circumlunar access. We have more information about this than we even have about the Onega rocket, and that's supposed to be the launcher for goodness sake - nobody disputes that because it's boring, but reliably reported. As unlikely as it might be, if the same director said 'we plan to launch Kliper with a Saturn 5', I'd laugh my ass off, but still report that he said it nonetheless.",0

The problem is there are not many active members on the site and we need more for the site to properly grow. It is well organized and on it's way to be a great site we just need more editors to expand. It is based on Wikia's network of wikis.

Now for the question you may be asking yourself. Why edit there? Wikipedia has articles on Liverpool. This is true. At the Liverpool wiki it is all about Liverpool. We allow editors to edit anything about Liverpool no matter how trivial. We allow edits on reserve and academy players, and even things as trivial as the fitness coaches for the year 2011. We also do not lock pages to registered users. That means if you have something to say about Steven Gerrard you can click edit and not view source and actually write something.

 :To be clear, I see no evidence that the 1875 NRA was a racist militia.  (It is very reasonable to guess that being located in a Union State that they were sympathetic to Union politics at the time.)  My point is that this """"ban handgun ownership"""" sentence in this article serves to frame this article within a """"slippery slope"""" political argument mirroring that is seen on the gun blogs.  The present day Brady Campaign is not opposed to taking away handguns from law abiding people.  To insert the 1976 """"long-term goal of the organization was a ban on handgun ownership"""" statement is a Red Herring and violates WP:NPOV. Consistently, for a very long time now, the Brady position has been """"defer to the judgments of elected officials who enact reasonable regulations on gun ownership, short of a broad gun ban, to protect the public from gun violence."""".  To be NPOV, we should not mirror the gun blog disinformation trying to implicate that Brady has some secret goal of a total ban on handgun ownership.     """,0

 == Sources which prove that actor Nick Adams was gay == 
 There is an edit war going on concerning the homosexuality of actor Nick Adams. Could I possibly ask you to have a look at the Talk:Nick Adams page? As a recent reply to administrator 's comment on this page,  has written, """"You clearly haven't read that link yourself. Why didn't you bother to check it? Maybe because you're so busy as a new Wikipedia:Admin?"""" This sounds very similar to flamings by  who, some weeks ago, frequently deleted all references relating to Adams's homosexuality. See also his reply to administrator  on  """"Yet again I have to request that you read facts and know what you are talking about before commenting. I suggest, since this matter is in the hands of Wikipedia:Mediator Ed Poor, that it might be best for you to refrain from further comments and not interfere in the process."""" See, in addition, this user's attempts at silencing me by repeatedly accusing me of vandalism and deleting my contributions to the Talk:Nick Adams page and some related pages. Why are users Wyss and Ted Wilkes so keenly interested to suppress every reference that Nick Adams was gay? See also Natalie Wood and Talk:Natalie Wood where information concerning Wood's contacts to Hollywood gays taken from a current biography has been repeatedly deleted by user Wyss. On the Talk:Nick Adams page, this user now claims that he """"found zero documented evidence to even thinly support any assertion under WP standards that Mr Adams was a homosexual"""" and that none of my edits """"are supported by documented evidence cited in peer-reviewed, secondary sources"""". In my opinion, this seems to be a new strategy by user Ted Wilkes (using an alias) to suppress any reference that Adams was gay. I am quite sure that users Ted Wilkes and Wyss must be identical, as  is all too familiar with David Bret's writings (see also Talk:David Bret) and uses similar arguments as Ted Wilkes presents to suppress my contributions to the articles on Nick Adams and Natalie Wood. Significantly, the following sentence can be found on 's page: """"I think the Internet trolls inhabiting Wikipedia are its biggest weakness since they stir up unhelpful vandalism throughout helpful anarchy."""" In addition, the """"barnstar of diligence"""" is appearing on both of their pages. See  and . What do you think?

 I fail to see why you need this explained to the letter. He wants to depict certain wars as war crimes themselves not based upon actual outrageous events that are well defined war crimes, but on ambiguous legal opinions tied to the intentions or rationales used by the belligerents involved in starting them. This is POV forking because it tries to establish a point of view not at all justifiable within the articles concerning war crimes nor the wars themselves' legalities sections.

What is his POV? Please pay attention and do not waste my time.

 === My hatnote update at Nostradamus === 

 It wasn't a question of notability when I performed this edit. I believe someone can easily mis-type the word, arrive at a """"strange"""" page and become confused, hence, the purpose of the hat (see the ones at Yamucha and Yum cha). Want another? Try Rogue and Rouge. Or Salon and Saloon, etc. Point being, I see no harm in it. Thoughts? Please reply on your talk page, or on Talk:Nostradamus. Prefer keeping all discussions in one page.   •   

 Above comment copied from my talk page.    

 :So my edit summary was a bit confused: """"moved Nas' work over to the dab page... there is not reason that Nastradamus is more notable than some of the other items there"""" - what I meant to say that there was no obvious way to elevate Nastradamus (a different spelling but also inspired by Nostradamus)  above the other articles which needed to be disambiguated. So it makes sense to treat them all somewhat equally on the disambiguation page. 
 :*I will admit that given the concerns about including even one hatnote on the page, I didn't think there would be immediate consensus to start putting even more... and that factored into my decision to revert. 
 :*The specific hatnote implies that not only is the article not what some are looking for (for which the other uses links will work), but that there is a likelihood of confusion:""""Not to be confused with Nastradamus."""" 
 :**I think someone looking for anything vaguely like Nas' album is not going to think that Nostradamus might be what they are looking for...  
 :*The examples you cire, Yamucha and Yum cha are an isolated pair of confusable articles with no related disambiguation page (and really, with just two articles using two distinct names, that's fine) - the hatnotes are the sole disambiguation needed. 
 :* the other two are pairs of disambiguation pages, where hatnotes and disambiguation links are basically free to flourish. 
 :*I would draw your attention to more similar cases where there is a dominant topic with a subordinate disambiguation page, like MP3 or Monk. 
 :* Or for that matter, the Nas article itself... which would only be hurt by adding a series of WP:POINT hatnotes on top: 
 :**Not to be confused with Naas, a town in Ireland. Not to be confused with Naval air station. and so on. 
 :** for me, personally, Nas means network attached storage, and clearly Nas does not cover that... so I go to the dab page. 
 : Anyway, as i noted, I have added Nastradamus to the Nostradamus (disambiguation) page as another possible misspelling. I have no objection to moving up to a hatnote on the disambiguation page, but I don't think that is really necessary or would improve things. I do not see a good reason to include it and only it as a hatnote to Nostradamus... I think a person looking for the album will be able to follow to the disambiguation page. Thoughts?   """,0

 User Emmette has been engaged over the past several weeks all over wikipedia changing all instances of the Palestinian National Authority into """"Palestinian territories"""", including in places where it is an absolute nonsense, like creating redirects President of the Palestinian Territories (The President is of course of the Palestinian Authority), Foreign Affairs Minister of the Palestinian territories, or Passport of the Palestinian territories. He got so much angry that there is any editor, not sharing his opinion, that he personally attacked me by spamming my talk page with meaningless repeated notifications like """"you changed  page"""" (see , ,  etc.). At some point he got so flustrated, that he issued a sockpuppet rename procedure of this article in my name (see below), presenting me in a very negative light (asking renaming """"Palestinian territories"""" into """"?"""" article, which is a ridiculous rename request). As a result i issued a complaint on his regard on administration board, which however didn't stop Emmette from trying to fame me on false accusations like: 
 ::He has done this to so many pages though that before using a page that calls the Territory's """"Palestinian Authority"""" as evidence against this, you'd need to check the edit history to see if it is Greyshark himself who made it say """"Palestinian Authority"""". 
 ::I'm inviting people who were involved in similar discussions regarding Greyshark's PT to PA changes. I've only invited people who oppose them so far. 
 He is trying to portrait me as the only person objecting his """"rightful"""" or """"correct"""" edits, but the fact is that there are of course editors, which don't share Emmette's opinion (see even at this very page Talk:Palestinian_territories#Administrative_center). I see all the above as a pointless bullying campaign by Emmette to force his opinion that """"Palestinian National Authority"""" instances should all be renamed into """"Palestinian territories"""", no matter the context, and misrepresent my opinion that both terms should be used according to their proper meaning (Palestinian Authority is a geopolitical entity, with territory, government and population of Palestinian Authority citizens, whilst """"Palestinian territory"""" or """"Pt"""" is a geographic term with several meanings, one of which is WB and GS, while another is areas under the control of the Palestinian Authority).

She had no gripe with women in general (and regularly slept in the same bed as other women).  If you have a reference that states otherwise, I would be interested in seing it.

 == """"Shoot the Moon"""" == 

 In the liner\program notes of my local cable provider, in the """"Wyatt Earp"""" movie, the character(and therefore alluding to the actual historical person,) was said to be a """"Southern boy"""". However, the actual history is plainly seen that Wyatt and his family hail from the north (Illinois, later California, with Wyatt rambling about in Missouri, and Kansas). His brief troubles in Arkansas would harldly qualify him as a """"son-of-the-south"""", to say the least. The tag on the liner notes suggests that arguably the greatest """"cowboy"""" who never was can be claimed by """"Southern Revauchists"""" 

 Nothing is obviously further from the truth. Although most Hollywood films(and vintage dime-store novels) have been out right lies about Earp and his exploits and personal dealings, the Kevin Costner film ironically comes closer to the truth. Added to the fact the the ENTIRE EARP CLAN were fierce Lincolnite Republicans, fought for the Northern Union, and despised the southern, pro-slavery Democratic Party, of which the Earps' nemeses the Clantons, Mcclareys, and the cowboy\russler gangs belonged. 

 What's ironical in this is that the elongated bio-pic of Earp, gives a more accurate account of the wherefores and whyfors of Wyatt's personality and motivations(unlike the current trend of deconstructionism in most modern biographies in film and print). The curious """"public"""" reaction of disfavor in the iconic western hero presented as yet another pragmatic and woefully flawed H-U-M-A-N, is more likely limited to the cracker-minded mentality of those who would rather live and die by fantasy over historical veracity. Also the boiling-up of old hatreds between """"Yankees"""" and """"Rebels"""". (Of course it must be said that Hollywood had-as yet-an unexplained growing hatred towards Costner at about this time.) Wyatt can't be claimed by 'southern' romantics, not now, and of course, never. 

 The misleading liners on the cable program must be changed.

"== Re:DYKsuggestion format == 

 Hi Politizer, just wondering about the output of your DYKsuggestion template. 

 I notice for example that for the Zhao Zongru hook, the template is outputting the following:  

  | creator           = Nlu 
  | creator2          =  
  | creator3          =  
  | creator4          =  
  | expander          =  
  | expander2         =  
  | expander3         =  
  | nominator         =  
  | comment           =  
  | image             =  
  | credits           =  
  *{{DYKmake|Zhao Zongru|Nlu}} 

 I can't really see the point in all this. Once DYKsuggestion has outputted the credit string, ie *{{DYKmake|Zhao Zongru|Nlu}}, why do we need all the rest? It seems redundant and it takes up a lot of space. Also, we are experiencing increasing problems with loading times for the page, so the less text the better. 

 One other thing, I've noticed your code outputs this whole DYKsuggestion thing in brackets {{}}. Is there a reason for that? I can't see why they are needed.    

 :I agree with you that now that we have the credit templates created, there's not a whole lot of reason to output the rest.  I know Suntag, for example, likes having all of that output because he says it makes it easier to see who's who, and easier to modify things if you need to (ie, if the nominator forgot to credit someone, or if you want to add an image or something); I agree with that to a point, but if the size is beginning to create page load problems then we should at least find a happy medium, I guess. 
 :My dream has been to get the DYKsug template working in such a way that it calls  but only with the parameters that the person actually filled in...so the output for Nlu's nom above would be more like 

  | creator           = Nlu 
  | credits           =  
  *{{DYKmake|Zhao Zongru|Nlu}} 
 :I've been having a bitch of a time getting that to work; it looks like it should be a simple matter of putting in some #if: expressions, but I haven't had any luck yet; I asked Ameliorate! to look into it a while back but I think he was away at the time, so I might try nudging him/her again or getting in touch with Lifebaka, who has also helped out with the template. 

 :As for why the code outputs DYKsuggestion in brackets...well, it gets a little confusing even for me, because I didn't create the template top-down like I should have, but put things together piece by piece, making changes when a problem came up, etc., so right now it's thrown together a bit randomly.  But basically, subst'ing the  template made the output really ugly...what you see on the page looks beautiful, but what you see in the edit window is horrible (see here for an example).  So part of the reason the DYKsuggestion stuff is generated in templates is because that template is always transcluded, rather than subst'ed when it's first called.  On the other hand, DYKsug (the template on the outside that calls it) is always subst'ed...the main reason for this is because if a template is transcluded, the section edit link it creates on the right-hand side of the page would cause you to be editing the template itself, rather than the section on T:TDYK...so we needed the outside template to be subst'ed to create a working section edit link (as well as a few little things—the credits templates, and a timestamp that stays the same as it was when you first made the nom) as well as an inside template that would never be subst'ed because the code it would produce is horrible. 
 :Anyway, I agree with you that something needs to be done...especially if the template is starting to affect load times.  Personally I think the best thing for now is to get  to only output the fields that the nominator actually filled in; if you think that's a good idea, I can start asking around for some help (unfortunately, I will be traveling and visiting friends for the next two weeks or so, starting today, so I might not have a good chance to devote a couple hours to template work).  If you don't think that's good enough, we can go back to the drawing board and see what else can be done. 
 :As a super-temporary fix, I can go into T:TDYK now and delete some of the extra unused text manually, just to get the loadtimes back to normal for a couple days. — ''''''/''''''",0

 *For tracks, use a numeral (e.g., """"4""""). 
 *For the opening date, link the components of the date (e.g., [[June 12]], [[2006]]). 
 *For next north/south info, use templates that reflect which service can take a passenger from the current station to the next one. For example, in the infobox at 28th Street (IRT Broadway-Seventh Avenue Line), one would NOT use {{NYCS Broadway-Seventh}} () for next north, despite the fact that 34th Street–Penn Station is an express station. Use {{NYCS Broadway-Seventh local}} (), because only the local services can transport passengers from 28th Street to 34th.

 :The problems is that the selection presents """"Independent Fundamentalist Baptists churches"""" as a single homogenous group in which this problem is widespread. Having not seen the 20/20 program in question, I can't comment as to how the program was presented,but you wrote """"The program featured a former member"""" - that's a member of a specific chruch, not a menber of allt he churches as a whole. Also, the statement that """"Several websites created by former IFB members alleged that the church is a dangerous cult"""" treat the group as one church, and the sites given are not considered reliable sources per WP:RS. Independent Baptists churches are by nature a very diverse droup with no single head, and it is very difficult to make blanket statements, as it is not a hierchial group like the Roman Catholic Church.

  تعد اللغة المروية القديمة من أقدم اللغات المكتوبة على وجه الأرض سوى أن  رموزها لم تفك بعد، حيث يرى المؤمنون بنطرية المؤامرةأن وراءعدم فك رموزها مؤامرة  من الآثاريين المصريين والأجانب المتواطئين معهم لتظل الآثار السودانية مغمورة ومجهولة ولا قيمة لها، لكني أظن أن البحوث ما تزال جارية لكنها لم تصل بعد  للنهاية فكل اللغات القديمة استغرق الكشف عنها وقتا طويلا فاللغة الهيروغليفية مثلا صمدت لثلاث ألفيات! فما أن توصل شامبليون الى المفتاح من اللغة القبطية القديمة التي كانت تنطق ولا تكتب حتى تيسرت له الترجمة... 
  سادت «مملكة مروي» ما بين 2500 ق. م. إلى القرن الخامس الميلادي، معاصرة للحضارة المصرية القديمة، وامتدت من الأقصر، جنوب مصر الى وسط السودان حول حوض النيل. لكن بعض المؤرخين يرون أن الحضارة المصرية، سبقت الحضارة المروية في تدوين أو كتابة اللغة بفترة طويلة، ويستدلون على هذا بأن ملك مروى الشهير ترهاقا الذي غزا مصر في القرن السابع ق.م. كتب واصفا غزواته وانتصاراته باللغة الهيروغليفية، إلا أنه في القرن الثاني ق.م. بدأت كتابة اللغة المروية. وتعود أول محاولة للعلماء الغربيين لمعرفة اللغة المروية القديمة إلى أكثر من 150 عاما، أي بعد وقت قصير من النجاح في الكشف عن اللغة المصرية القديمة. لكن العلماء فوجئوا بأن اللغة المروية هي لغة معقدة ومختلفة تماما عن اللغة المصرية القديمة التي تلجأ الى التصوير أو الرسم لطائر أو عين إلخ، بينما اللغة المروية صغيرة الحجم وشبيهة بالأرقام وتبدأ من اليمين للشمال، وبها حروف صغيرة وأخرى كبيرة «كالإنجليزية». وفي العام 1911 توصل عالم المصريات البريطاني جريفث الى معرفة نطق أو قراءة اللغة المروية، ولكن دون فهم معانيها. والانجاز الذي أعلن عنه مؤخراً في الخرطوم، هو نجاح العلماء الآن، في ترجمة 100 كلمة تتضمن 40 حرفا أساسيا، وإن لم يتوصلوا بعد الى معرفة كل مفردات اللغة المروية",0

As already mentioned, yes, it results in a """"mismatch"""" (I guess you could call it) of Google hits, but that doesn't make the concept, or even the article bad.

"""== """"Everything's Magic"""" on the Charts == 

 Since there have been several back-and-forth edits regarding this section in the past month, I want to clarify why the Hot 100 chart position of """"Everything's Magic"""" should read """"111"""", and not """"11"""". As the Wiki entry for Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles states: 

  
 [The Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart] comprises 25 positions that represent songs that are close to charting on the main singles chart, the Billboard Hot 100, acting as an extension to Hot 100. Many times, singles halt their progress at this chart, and never debut on the Hot 100. For example, Kelly Clarkson's """"The Trouble with Love Is"""" stayed at #101 and never went any higher. Also, more noticeable examples are Pet Shop Boys's """"Can You Forgive Her?"""", """"Go West"""", """"Before"""", """"Somewhere"""" and George Clinton's """"Atomic Dog"""", which halted their progress in #101, #106, #107, #125 and #109 respectively, never to appear again in the chart. 

  
 On the 09/22/07 Billboard chart, """"Everything's Magic"""" occupied the 11th position on the Bubbling Under chart. That means the song's peak to-date is #111 overall, not #11. I hope this clears up any confusion.

 Dr M, a few days ago I happened to be reading the article on Leonard Bernstein, the most prominent photo within which has a link to an article on its photographer, which at the time was horrific. I'm uninterested in dance and celebs, but interested in photography, and this man Mitchell was clearly """"notable"""" in both the Wikipedia and the sane sense. Temptingly glinting in the moonlight: the surgical steel of my editorial machete. I unsheathed the latter and got to work. But while I dislike the result less than I disliked what I first saw, I think it's still flabby (too much of the not so interesting about one or more photos of Lennon+Ono). However, I worry that my impatience with celebrity-obsession may be carrying me away. You seem to have a nose for this kind of thing; could I invite you to pay a visit?    """,0

We can retain that passage, with proper attribution and citation, if some notable source, similar to MMfA, has said something like, """"The industry is biased against libertarianism, and Stossel's adoption of that POV has caused the industry to shaft him when it comes to awards.""""  If we don't have a notable source expressing that opinion, then the statement should be deleted. 
 ::::::Overall, I don't know what you mean about """"context"""".  The context is that Stossel continues to generate controversy.

 *Yes, and the reason why this move request is so blatantly dishonest is because the same people (you, Calidum and NickCT) were also the main editors from the last move request. And you KNOW that the ngrams and google results were flawed. You KNOW that the results showing """"Hillary Clinton"""" -Rodham had many an instance with the name """"Hillary Rodham Clinton"""". Yet the results leading off this MR are hidden with caveats like """"since 2014"""" and such. You also know there has been no name change, and article title policy advises against moving contentious moves for stable articles. You also know since the last MR that policy has changed to give weight to the BLP subjects preference of their name. Which should make even more difficult to move HRC to HC. And despite all that, have worded the MR in a totally biased manner. Disregarding policy and reality. Dave Dial (talk)  Calling the move request dishonest IMO smacks of calling the people wrote it dishonest.  I wrote more than half of it even on the basis that I am currently neutral and have added my IAR argument in favour of keeping HRC.  However, as I presented on the article talk page """"""""

The reason we have Wikipedia policies like the country specific results for titles and self published names is to prevent moves like this.

 He saw that a movie CD was left on the table.The movie's name was AVP. It was his  
 favorite movie.He went near the DVD player and put the movie.He started watching it  
 but starting only he got scared because of the background music.After some time he was thinking why his mom is becoming late?.He was bored and decided to go to bed.when his eyes started closing he saw a shadow running.At that moment some one knocked the door.He ran fast.When he reached near the door he heard so many people screaming but he did not mind.When he opened the door it was not his mom but a boy.The boy said that you are in trouble and said that come with me fast.When they started running they turned back.They saw a black creature chasing them. 
 
 On a sudden they were pushed in by a power.when they opened there eyes they were lost in a desert.Toby started fighting with the other boy

 place is this?They went inside the palace.They saw a boy lying in the floor.When they went near them  

  
 Peter: Its Henry? 
 Toby: Your right its Henry  
 They both took him and went out of the palace.After some time they saw Henry moving his eyes little bit. 
 He woke up.They both asked 

  
 Peter: Henry how did you land up here? 
 Toby: Say something Henry! 
 Henry:I have no problem please say how did you both reach here and how did you both became freinds? 
 Peter: Long story!!! 
 Toby: Say your story Henry!!!!! 
 Henry: Me and my mom was returning after shopping on a sudden a spacecraft landed at the same spot where me and my mom was standing.The people of the spacecraft captured every single men and women including my mom.But I just escaped from them.I was running as fast as i could.I entered a big shop but when I entered one other black creature was there. He made one magical power and that magical power pushed me inside.Then when I opened my eyes I was lost in this place. 
 Peter: The same story happened to us also 
 Toby: Not the same almost the same 
 Henry: Should we sit here full day or start our journey  
 Toby: Peter he has a point!

 ====Yes → Yes (band)==== 
 This move has already taken place by doing a copy/paste. Someone needs to delete the Yes (band), which was a redirect to Yes, and then move the Yes to [[Yes (band). The reason for this request is that the vast majority of edits to Yes were related to the band and not the word.    
 *Yes is currently a simple dictdef.  Yes (band) should be at Yes with a link to Wiktionary for the word.    
 **I have no problem with that. I didn't move the article, I just wanted to get the page history straightened out.   
 *I've reverted it, and left a note on the Talk page to bring the argument here, and to use the Move tab if it should be moved. IMHO, someone looking for the word will go to Wiktionary, while someone looking for Yes at Wikipedia is more likely looking for the band, so I think it should stay that way. (i.e. 'what violet/riga said')   
 **That works for me.   
 *Support move to Yes (band). Yes should be a disambig. See Yes (disambiguation) for some ideas.    17:04, 2005 Jan 1 (UTC) 
 *Unless someone presents some other well-known things known only by the name Yes, then the band should be at Yes. I see nothing at Special:Allpages/Yes that would be referred to primarily (or even occasionally) by only the word Yes. ≠  
 *I was the original editor, and I'm willing to admit that I may have goofed.  I saw some similarity between Yes and Rush, both of which are common words with other uses, but I admit that the band may be the commonest use of Yes.  A quick search at IMDB, for instance, showed one art-house film, some foreign films, and a couple of shorts.  And I probably didn't wait long enough for a consensus, didn't use """"Move"""", etc.  I haven't been around here long enough to know which way the precedents point.   
 *Yes. Support the move.  06:42, 2005 Jan 3 (UTC) 
 *Support the move. As the name of a band, 'Yes' will only be known to a minority of readers.   
 *Support. My rule would be that a secondary meaning always calls for disambiguation. —  19:28, 2005 Jan 15 (UTC)""",0

 ==The End is Nigh== 

 Mr Wales, 

 I am a disgruntled former Wikipedia editor, and I have come up with the perfect plan to destroy your tax-shelter, Wikipedia.  My plan is much better than that amateur Daniel Brandt's.  I won't be doing any whining, but I will be exercising only my freedom of speech in a perfectly legal manner.  After I finish with you, the only money you'll be getting in donations is from your pals in the porn industry, and you'll have to start using banner ads.  I have resolved to destroy you, but I could be appeased and persuaded not to do so if you clean up your filthy act.  Here's how: 

 1)  Crude sexual humor (i.e. Cleveland steamer) and its ilk must be deleted. 
 2)  The Gay Nigger Association of America must go immediately.   
 3)  Initiate a means of asking editors and readers if they are over 18 when accessing explicit content. 
 4)  Delete Daniel Brandt's article, Angela Beesley's article, and the article of anyone else who has a reasonable request for deletion. 
 5)  Shut down AfD and delete things on your own. 
 6)  You have spoilers before content from a film, but your pervert users cry """"censorship!"""" when someone wants a warning before a picture of, say, an erect penis or a toilet full of human feces.  You will offer warnings. 
 7)  Transfer all fanboy junk to Wikia and delete.  I suggest giving the dorks a month to transfer their junk articles on phasers and such and then a mass deletion should ensue.  There should be only one article on Star Trek. 

 Should you block the account this came from (Instant Karma), the plan will automatically go into operation, and negotiations will cease.  Even when you find out who and what you are dealing with, you will not be able to stop this little plan from going into operation.  (See doomsday device and deterrence.)  The same will happen if this message is erased.  That means you, you petty little satraps known as """"admins, and you, Mr. Danny """"Yes, I'm a flak."""" Wool.  Remember, you cannot hurt me, but I can do a lot of damage to your enterprise.

 == Appearance on Real Housewives of Beverly Hills == 

 Allison DuBois was a dinner guest of cast member Camille Grammer on the episode of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills that aired December 16, 2010. Entries to her biography that refer to her guest appearance have been deleted and deemed """"vandalism"""". Her appearance was notable and should be included in her biography. Maybe a more neutrally-worded entry can be added that includes her behavior and some of the things she said on the show. Direct quotes from DuBois to cast member Kyle Richards include: 
 """"[Your husband] will never emotionally fulfill you, know that. As soon as the kids are bigger, you’ll have nothing in common,"""" """"You are entirely washed up,"""" and """"You have achieved nothing in life.""""  

 DuBois' comments to the entire dinner party guests concerning her abilities and career include: 
 """"I was studied by a scientist and was on Oprah… I’m like a drug, once you get one you want more,"""" and """"I have books written on me and by me, and a television show is based on my life, so you can just like take a flying leap.""""  

 After the party was over, DuBois spoke to her friend Camille Grammer and Grammer's friend D.D. about Kyle Richards. She said of Richards: 
 """"I don’t give a sh*t what [Kyle] thinks about me, she can f*ck off. I can tell you when she will die and what will happen to her family. I love that about me,"""" """"Kyle is a little bitch... Kyle was every girl at a high school that made somebody kill themselves. She’s that girl, that’s so mean and profoundly bankrupt. I’m going to shove this [electronic cigarette] up her ass to make a point, except she’d need a bigger one to even feel it. Oh yeah, I went there,"""" and """"Can I say this, if any of their children disappeared, they wouldn’t be like ‘You were wrong,’ they’d be like ‘Can you help?' F*ck them."""" 

 I'm relatively new here and am uncertain of the guidelines for editing protected entries. I pulled these quotes directly from the show and in some cases replayed segments to verify their accuracy. (I'm pretty certain that they are accurate quotes although some minor words may differ.) Given that DuBois said these things on a reality television show, I think that it's notable and should be included in her biography. I run the blog Celebitchy and have also posted the quotes there. (You are welcome to delete this link if it violates guidelines. This is just to provide a reference.)

 ==A couple of  external links that could be useful== 
 At least in the explanation of the history of the US Constitutional seperation of church and state would be Patrick Henry's A Bill Establishing a Provision for Teachers of the Christian Religion and James Madison's (then anononymous) response, A Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessment]. While these two documents apply to Virginia law of the time rather than to the US Constitution, I think they both give good insight into two competing views of the relationship of religious and secular authority during the birth of the US. - 

 ==What did the Court actually say?== 
 I have a question please about the following paragraph. 
 :When fundamentalists attempted to force biology teachers to teach the Genesis creation story if they taught evolution, the Supreme Court ruled that labeling a religious doctrine as """"science"""" was insufficient to allow it to be taught to a child in public school for the purpose of converting the child to a religion.  
 To FairAndBalanced.  You wrote that """"the Supreme Court ruled that labeling a religious doctrine as """"science"""" was insufficient to allow it to be taught to a child in public school for the purpose of converting the child to a religion."""" Could you point to the page in the case where the Court said that? 

 It seems to me that the Court found that the Act failed the first prong of the Lemon test""""secular purpose.""""  Accordingly, the Court ruled on summary judgment and did not have to examine whether the thousand pages of """"science"""" that the creationists filed was actually  """"science"""" or not.  Would you agree?   
 ::That does not invalidate my version, but feel free to change it to stick more closely to the strict legal reasoning.  The previous version inappropriately implied that ID was scientific.   

 ==Fundamentalist attempt to force biology teachers to teach Genesis== 
 When fundamentalists attempted to force biology teachers to teach the Genesis creation story if they taught evolution, the Supreme Court ruled that even scientific evidence could not be taught to a child in public school for the purpose of converting the child to a religion. That is, religious people could not appropriate snippets of scientific evidence with the aim of persuading public school children to adopt religious beliefs. 
 :Where is Intelligent Design even implied in the above statement?   
 :How about you and I start from the above and change it so that you think it is accurate. 
 :Or how about quoting the Supreme Court? 
 When fundamentalists attempted to force biology teachers to teach the Genesis creation story if they taught evolution, the Supreme Court ruled that """"teaching a variety of scientific theories about the origins of humankind to schoolchildren might be validly done with the clear secular intent of enhancing the effectiveness of science instruction. But because the primary purpose of the Creationism Act is to endorse a particular religious doctrine, the Act furthers religion in violation of the Establishment Clause.""""  In other words, the Court did not have to examine whether what was taught under the Creationism Act was scientifically accurate.  Only the legislators' intent to teach religion mattered to the Court.  
 :Are we getting somewhere?    

 ==Separation of politics and religion in the US== 
 I agree with ' edits, which resulted in a text that expressed what I meant better than my original. However, I reverted """"estrangement"""" to """"separation"""". """"Estrangement"""" is separation, but with the added nuance of some hostility. I don't think that hostile feelings are an issue here – it's just that some countries separation religion and politics by tradition, and many people adhere to this vision without being hostile to religion. It's just like strawberry marmalade and steak - you may like each separately, but think, without any kind of bad feeling, that they do not mix well. See laïcité for instance. [[User",0

 ::Hi Brian... when it comes to full names (as in the example above) its probably best just to get rid of the middle name (this can get tricky in pageantry where names are often used in full where they are not used in full in common usage).  As for Erica Commeau... that was probably my fault!  What you did with Eurlyne/Arlene Howell was perfect  just what I would have done had I picked up on it.  There's no hard and fast rule but I'd say that if you can prevent a redirect by piping... go for it (or simply by chopping out the middle name as suggested).

 History 

 Early years (1995 – 1998) 
 Early formations of a band were beginning to coalesce as early as 1992 with the core band members, drummer Shawn Crahan, vocalist Anders Colsefini, and bassist Paul Gray enlisting the help of guitarists Donnie Steele and Quan Nong.[1] 

 In September 1995, the band The Pale Ones was created comprising Crahan on drums, Gray on bass, Colsefini on vocals and guitarist Steele.[2] Joey Jordison joined the band shortly after, taking up the role of drummer and, subsequently, Crahan moved to percussion.[3] The band continued to develop their vision of what the band would be, deciding to add a second guitarist, recruiting Josh Brainard and moving Colsefini to percussion along with lead vocals.[4] The band played their first live performance under the name of Meld on December 4, 1995 at a club called Crowbar in Des Moines.[5] Soon after, Jordison suggested renaming the band """"Slipknot"""" after their song that eventually appeared on Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat..[6] The band also began experimenting with their image, wearing grotesque make up and eventually the anti-image concept developed towards the members wearing masks.[7] Up until this point, the band had remained mainly obscured due to their desire to wait until their music was fully developed.[6] 

  Slipknot """"Slipknot"""" (1996)  
 
 29 second sample from the song """"Slipknot"""" which the band was eventually named after. Slipknot's earlier music was slower than their later material and vocalist Colsefini had a much deeper vocal style than that of Taylor.[8]

 With plenty of material ready, the band began recording in a local studio, SR Audio with Sean McMahon.[9] In February 1996, guitarist Steele left the band due to his Christian beliefs; though the other band members were prepared to allow him to stay, Steele decided to leave.[10] His replacement, Craig Jones, arrived during the mixing stages of this new project.[10] On April 4, Slipknot played their first public performance at Des Moines reggae club the Safari, where they played most of their early gigs.[11] Their second gig at the Safari",0

"Ok. My interest is in verifying the information that was requested. My bias is investigative journalism. I investigate and check up facts. I have been checking up on facts on Wikipedia on many articles and removing arguments and fitting NPOV recommendations to the articles I know about. I check up on articles that I know something about. I also know a bit about NLP and have learned a lot more recently. I (and others here) have had wild acusations chucked at us for no apparent reason apart from the fact that we are not particularly promotional editors. Now lets have some honesty from you. As per our discussion on my talkpage the IP checker showed your IP is Australian and mine is Dutch. After a brief investigation on Wikipedia a minute or so ago I found the only term -Comaze- is a firm promoting NLP in Australia. You and Comaze have spent the last few weeks covering up reliable and relevant yet negative facts and views about NLP. So now its all open and honest. I have been learning a lot more about NPOV policy the last few days and I have to say that you or Comaze seem to me to be fighting hard against the inclusion of all relevant views. User Woohookitty did say that this article had too much promo and argument and I am here to repair that and other articles. At the top of this section I appealed for fairness and balance after inclusion of all relevant views. You have fought against that appeal for reasonable discussion and inclusion and you have just deleted a whole lot of straight reporting in favour of your and Comazes own opinion and commentary. Stop working against NPOV policy, stop deleting relevant views, and start adding some sources to the views you want included. Then we can get on with discussing balance and fairness.",0

 ==Coinage== 
 Does anyone know when this phrase was coined?   

 ===I know this=== 
 The term is related to the improvements made to automobiles.  Those improvements made driving an automobile simpler and easier.  The automatic transmission is the most important of them. Driving an automobile became simpler when the manual foot-operated clutch was eliminated.  The term appeared around 1955 to 1960.   

 By the way, let me say this: in the 1940s few women drove automobiles.  Some automobiles required the use of a hand crank to start the engine.  Only strong men could start a car that used a hand crank.  Today, electric starters allow anyone to start an automobile. 

 I had wished to answer the question at the top of this page in 2006, but I kept on putting it off.  

 Early automobiles required the driver to manually control ignition timing and operate a hand fuel pump, changing gear often required the use of pre-selectors or """"double de-clutching"""" techniques.  The elimination of the clutch with auto boxes has never been universally adopted so can't be the """"most important"""". Besides it hasn't benn """"eliminated""""; I've never owned a car with automatic transmission.   

 ==The connection to American slavery==   
 This page is one of the best pages in the Wikipedia.  I located it less than an hour ago.   

 The practice of keeping Negroes in a mentally inferior position was a practice which ensured that peaceful slaves would form the bulk of their group.   

 At times, the leader of a group of slaves would be killed to remove the most capable person from the group.  Wiki Apalachee reveals that Spanish missionaries were slain in order to weaken a group of Indians.  Dumbing down of slaves is an old practice.  It has resurged in the United States since 1950.  The appearance of new laws such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 produced hostility amidst the more numerous white people.  Negroes have undergone a dumbing down in the USA since 1950.  There are fewer educated Negroes today, particularly doctors (including dentists) and nurses.  Modern people claim that Negroes are too dumb to be dentists, despite the fact that Negro doctors and nurses were commonly-seen components of the United States before 1970.   

 Even very simple tasks such as driving a truck are now viewed as being things that Negroes are too dumb to accomplish.  Slaves had cooked food for their masters, but modern Negroes are regarded as being too dumb to learn how to prepare food.  The dumbing down of Negroes is an industry in the USA.        

 :Under the older way of life called """"racial segregation'"""" colored people in the United States were forced to produce their own doctors, dentists, nurses, restaurateurs, nightclub owners, taxi-cab company owners, and other people because that was their only way to receive various common services. (Taxi-cab companies would not ride Negroes).  After the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1957, """"racial integration"""" appeared.  Under the new """"racial integration"""" way of life, it is theoretically possible for a colored physician to treat white patients in a medical facility.  The way to keep that scenario from becoming a reality is to keep the colored people too dumb to become skilled medical practitioners.  Ergo, dumbing down is rampant, pernicious, and ubiquitous, now.  There used to be a need for colored doctors, dentists, nurses, etc., but """"racial integration"""" has replaced them with people of other racial types.    
 ::That made no sense as it had no context.-''''''   ''''   ''''''  

 What a bizarre pair of posts, a series of racist generalizations with absolutely no supporting evidence, using obsolete terms (""""Negroes"""", """"coloreds""""), all in support of the idea that civil rights gains have led to the """"dumbing down"""" of a race. And these gems of quotes: 

 Under the new """"racial integration"""" way of life, it is theoretically possible for a colored physician to treat white patients in a medical facility.   

 Slaves had cooked food for their masters, but modern Negroes are regarded as being too dumb to learn how to prepare food.

 == Summarizing the problems identified so far == 

 1. There is no source for the claim that Chambers had previously denied under oath that Hiss was a spy. Moreover, this is misleading considering the fact that Chambers identified Hiss as a secret Communist back in 1939. 

 2. Lead fails to make clear the important nature of the evidence against Hiss (the notes in particular), and the consensus against Hiss. 

 3. No source is provided for the claim that Hiss's work at Yalta was confined to the U.N. 

 4. The testimony of Bullit and Weyl seems unimportant to the case against Hiss. 

 5. Nixon is quoted out of context regarding how he handled in the investigation, which was not about convicting Hiss in court. Taped evidence that Nixon believed that Hiss and Chambers were Communists is ignored. 

 6. No sources are provided for the following POV pushing: Unlike the FBI, Military Intelligence had extensive experience forging typed documents, since every agent behind enemy lines during World War II required phony documentation to support his cover story. Moreover, with its special agent initiating the search for Hiss's typewriter while disguised as Chief Investigator for the Hiss defense, Military Intelligence could have planted forged evidence without arousing suspicion. Thus, the judges' reasons for disregarding forensic evidence of forgery do not apply to Military Intelligence. In the future, some of the misconduct previously attributed to the FBI by Hiss and his defenders may turn out to have been the work of Army counterintelligence. 

 7. Kobyakov is quoted as saying that Hiss never had a relationship with SVR predecessor organizations. This is fundamentally misleading to the reader because Hiss was accused of being with the GRU.  

 8. The statement In 2007, Svetlana Chervonnaya, a Russian researcher who had been studying Soviet archives since the early 1990s, stated that Hiss' name was absent from Soviet archives. is false. She said that the documents that she reviewed (mainly """"publicly accessible files"""") do not show Hiss's name. 

 9. The section on Noel Field fundamentally misleads the reader by not mentioning the fact that Field was not being tortured and was in fact being """"rehabilitated"""" at the time he implicated Hiss. In 1957, Field personally wrote Hiss a letter affirming his belief in the latter's innocence is POV pushing in the extreme considering that if Field was a Communist in league with Hiss he would never have admitted it on paper. Also ignores the fact he chose to remain in Communist Hungary for the rest of his life.  

 10. There is no business for giving Hiss's lawyer so much space on Venona, especially when much of his argument was discredited back in 2005.  

 11. The section on Oleg Gordievsky is unclear whether he got the information about Hiss from Venona or just the codename ALES.  

 12. Guttenplan admits he is not a scholar of the Hiss-Chambers case, rendering his speculations quite irrelevant considering the widespread acceptance of the notes.  

 13. The use of Kisseloff violates Wikipedia policy regarding self-published sources. 

 14. Non-existent """"other historians"""" are used to push original research.

 ::::And tell me something else.  How come the only POV warriors you seem to find are those who disagree with you? One of the biggest reasons why I don't like getting involved in these arguments you get into is because you seem to have convinced yourself that you have a monopoly on NPOV.  If you disagree with what others say, it is because they have a bias, or are paid operatives, or some other bad faith bullshit claim along those lines.  It speaks volumes that you never seem to find paid POV operatives on your side of the debate. 

 ::::I get that these topic areas are important to you. And even if they aren't for me, they might be for others.  And when those others come along, you need to accept that they may not agree with you.  In that case, all sides need to not yell over top of each other but focus on the disputed claim(s) and respond with citations and sources.  If you want people like me to get involved with resolving a dispute, don't give me many thousand words.  Give me the claims you disagree with, and the citations that prove your point.  Then, and only then, will these disputes get resolved amicably.  Because the alternative is ANI.  And while I have already threatened to take you back there if this continues - and don't doubt that I will - I would rather not because I think we both know you are standing on a treadmill that will speed you right off of this project.  I would rather not accelerate that and I think most others don't either, but you really need to work with the people around you.

"What on hell has the great migration with the Turkish people in Bulgaria? You claim that the Turkish people settled here during the Great Migrations?    
  	   	  
 The initial period starts during the 4th century and assumes a more massive character in the eve of the establishment of the Bulgar state. It continues until the transformation of the Tengriist Turkic Bulgars into the Slavic Bulgarians within a hundred years following their conversion to Orthodox Christianity in the middle of the ninth century.

 The Byzantine period includes the years of Byzantine rule during which the Pechenegs, Uzes (Oghuz Turks), and Cumans entered the Balkans. 

 :Those peoples are differed Turkic peoples, not the Turkish people.    
  	  
 The Ottoman period between the end of 14th and the 19th centuries during which the Turko-Islamic identity is consolidated. 

 :??? You can well write that statement in the following section.    
  	  
 In the course of these centuries Turkic communities gradually settled in Bulgaria. Turkic peoples, especially those who entered these territories during the Byzantine and Ottoman periods, left deep marks on the ethnic composition of the population. They played a decisive role in the formation of the Turkish community in Bulgaria.

"""::::B2C, you introduced the notion of meeting WP:COMMONALITY as a matter of degree. I, though, have taken is as a mere hurdle requirement. In this case, both spellings plainly meet that requirement, so it is reasonable to move on to other considerations. Here there are two: consistency within the article, and consistency between similar articles (a desideratum according to policy at WP:TITLE). The article is written in British English (for example with goitre, not goiter); so a spelling that tends the British way gives internal consistency. Do you find that other titles include semantically related forms beginning with """"iodiz-"""", or """"iodis-""""? I don't. I therefore think there is no problem with consistency between articles, either. 
 ::::As for the definition and individuation of words being a """"semantic"""" matter, I agree. Of course! Much that is important in RMs, and in the proper reading of guidelines and policies, is inevitably  """"semantic"""". That is simply to say that we have to attend to meanings. Surprised by that?

 ::""""I met Prince Radu at the Elisabeth Palace,...Prince Radu is extremely involved in his mission as a special representative of the Romanian government, a position for which he and the entire Royal Family have used all their energies of altruism. 
 ::.... 
 ::This unusual status as a special representative provides, however, the best outlet for an outpouring of love for Romania, a love that King Michael and those who are close to him have stockpiled over the years. These are stockpiles of love created over tens of years of painful exile and other several difficult years after December 1989, during which time the King's family suffered tremendously for the help they were not allowed to give to the mother-country......Prince Radu was not born with blue blood, but he lives a life too imbued by the spirit of this special group to be considered an """"outsider"""". 
 ... 
 ::The man who is now the bearer of Romania's message into the world, as well as the image of the Royal House in Romania, has much to say and does not waste his time. He travels all over America to tell the students who will run tomorrow's companies and institutions that somewhere in Europe lies a country that has something to offer. 

 ::He invites managers of big American corporations to fly into Bucharest before taking off for Beijing, because they might just discover a better place for business. He meets with friends and relatives from European royal houses to lobby in favor of Romania's admission into the E.U. on 1 January 2007. He goes to Moldova to tell our neighbors that the mother-country has not forgotten them. 
 .. 
 ::He does a lot for a position which is basically an honorary one. But he does it well and does it for a purpose, with discretion, diplomacy, background, respect, and honor. However, these are things one never sees. For everything else there's another kind of Romania."""" 

 ::In another article, in Cotidianul (http://www.cotidianul.ro/index.php?id=3618&art;=8033&cHash;=93858fe5e1) journalist Alin Ionescu admits, with surprise, that he has changed his opinion of Prince Radu . Mr Ionescu expresses his respect for Prince Radu's elegance and modesty in the way he expresses himself, his clean and relaxed  attitude,and his appreciation for Radu's evolution and growth over the past few years. 

 :Intro in Romanian: """"L-am vazut pe principele Duda in emisiunea dnei Vrinceanu-Firea si am impresia ca e alt om decit cel pe care-l stiam."""" 

 :Another article about the Prince's character http://www.waseda.jp/eng/news03/0508e.html

The audience consisted of not only Waseda faculty, students, and staff members but also diplomats, scholars, and journalists from outside the university community.

 =Coulter and Racism/Sexism= 

 == Ann Coulter is racist and sexist == 

 Just to experiment with the wikipedia policy, I want to know what people think of stating in the article (along with """"republican"""") that Coulter is: 

 Racist:  
 *""""When we were fighting communism, OK, they had mass murderers and gulags, but they were white men and they were sane. Now we're up against absolutely insane savages.""""  she is implying that white men (sexist and racist), are more sane then non-white men. 
 **Logical fallacy.  All she is saying is the known fact that at the time she said it, in countries where there is a majority of white people, the countries are ruled by laws.  The fallacy is confusing:  """"nearly all white men live in a nation of laws and are therefore sane"""", with """"nearly all white men live in a nation of laws because they are sane"""".  Rather, it's the law that enforces the sanity.  
 *** You mean the rule of law existed in """"communist"""" countries and the Vietnamese, the Chinese, the North Koreans and the Cubans...etc were white? Come on, why would you even try to defend people like her? She is obviously trying to get attention by saying outrageous things.  
 **** She was refering to communism in USSR   
 **** How can you tell? She doesn't explicitly state so. And I suppose then that Korean war wasn't about fighting """"communists""""? 
 ***I am not making a fallicious statement. If it is her belief that race has nothing to do with rule of law, why does she bring it up. Clearly she thinks race is important in this issue, which makes her racist.   
 ****As a class the white race is nearly universally an educated one.  That's simply a fact, not racism.  
 *****Next!   
 ******I don't understand what that means.   
 ******* It means that he's dismissing your statement that all other races are not as """"nearly universally educated"""" as the white """"class"""" as Nazi-esque rhetoric. Just because more people who are white in the world are educated, statistically, doesn't mean that you can hold that against the people who aren't white. There are plenty of uneducated white people you can run into on the street. 
 ******** She's not holding it against anyone, she's holding up the white race as a model for this specific attribute:  controlling itself by offering everyone a place in society that is worth living to keep.  This fact doesn't exclude other means by which other races may be held up as models of controlling themselves:  for example, by having a great heart or by experience with nature and other social bonds of their culture.  
 ******** And when I said """"as a class"""" I meant """"as a class"""".  A class by definition contains individual differences. 
 ******** And thirdly you're making it sound like I said all other races aren't nearly as educated as whites when what I really said was that whites were nearly all educated.   
 ****She realized her audience would recognize this and form in their minds a vivid contrast to those zealots, like those who crashed airplanes into the U.S. landmarks, who seem to not even possess reason.  
 :Of course! That's the point; her audience is as racist as she is. And, apparently, just as capable of denying it.  
 ::What do you mean, her audience is just as racist as she is?  That's what this discussion was intended to prove, that she is racist.  You are begging the question and saying it doesn't even need to be established in the first place.  If it were so obvious we wouldn't be having the discussion at all.  And a fortiori you can't be adjudged """"capable of denying"""" something that hasn't been proven you've done to begin with.   

 You are missing the point people! 
 In response to the anon (white race is nearly universally an educated one.  That's simply a fact, not racism.): 
 They (we;), are more educated than """"the savages"""", because white people are generally richer and have better access to education. Again, not because of the skin color. while its a fact, its a circumstantial fact with no meaning, so its racist to bring it up. So Coulter is racist, so can we please start arguing about it and agree with what i say?? heh -Mir

 Secondly, if Jewett in fact didn't claim the wreckage, what is the point of reporting Weddell's conjectures about Jewett's intentions? Also, if those hypothesis are reported by a secondary source (Cawkell), does it mean that the secondary source avails them?

 (Resetting inserts). I guess the logic is a bit complex here. I am not disputing the fact that most countries do not accept Jerusalem as Israel's capital. What I am disputing is that most, some, or even any countries have made it an official policy to make Tel Aviv Israel's capital instead. I also accept the fact that in Egypt, the distinction between government policy and the press is very ehmm, porous, but I still haven't seen it stated as official policy by any sovereign government that """"Tel Aviv is Israel's capital."""" My guess is that the publishers of the encyclopedia didn't want to write nothing about Israel's capital, and so said """"Tel Aviv."""" 

 And there's a good reason for that. Countries that accept Israel's sovereignty must by necessity also accept Israel's sovereign right to establish a capital wherever Israel's government wants. Countries clearly have a problem with Israel's establishing their capital in Jerusalem for reasons that are beyond the scope of this article, but they have no basis to say """"well, then it should be in Tel Aviv"""" or """"it should be in Haifa"""" or """"it should be in Ashdod."""" And countries that don't accept Israel's sovereignty wouldn't accept an Israeli capital at all. 

 You have only being able to pull out highly circumstantial evidence that the Egyptian government possibly considers Tel Aviv to be Israel's capital. This would lead us to simply omit any discussion of Tel Aviv in that context, unless we want to write something silly like """"an encyclopedia published under the auspices of the Egyptian ministry of culture states that Tel Aviv is Israel's capital.""""

I protest, because if you go and see where I said that in context it's very clear that I was using it as a synonym for the opposite of the word """"fan"""", in the context of a discussion on the roles of fans and opposite of fans on Wikipedia; how fans and """"haters"""" are responsible for most of the content on Wikipedia, as they are motivated, and both are biased, but they can still author NPOV articles; and that indifferent people, while maybe ideal authors for articles in order to get it NPOV, are very difficult to motivate to help author articles.

That's all I've ever wanted and I think an investigation of the history of that and related articles and talk pages will show my behavior to have been exemplary.  I will admit, however, that the real reason I don't edit the article isn't because of what JW said that day (please also see his comment on the NXIVM talk page), but rather because they know where I live, if you know what I mean, and it's just a few miles from him and it, and that I'm just another nobody in particular who spends way too much of his life on Wikipedia; whereas they are mind-bogglingly rich, connected, and powerful people.

 A list of English foodies has nothing really to do with English cuisine. A list of foodies (of any nationality) who cook and contribute to English cuisine is more appropriate, and would include Ramsay.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by     

 I have now made this edit, the original wording was ambiguous and indeed could be read to imply everyone on the list was English.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by     

 ==Rewrite required== 

 This article consists, as earlier editors have noted for the past 8 years or more, mainly of personal opinion (that's WP:POV and WP:OR for standards-lovers, and only a step off jokiness at that). Almost every section needs to be substantially rewritten, starting from published sources, with new citations. 

 The list of cooks probably needs to be hived off as a separate article, divided into centuries with far more weight to earlier times (WP:RECENTISM probably applies to much of the rest of the article also), and cited throughout. 

 Given the widespread lack of citations and of historical perspective, almost any degree of slash-and-burn editing would seem justified. The article currently favours a slightly nostalgic look at some mythical, mid 20th century period (avoiding the wars and the great depression) when everyone had a full English breakfast, ate a Sunday roast for lunch, and sat down to dainty Edwardian tea, before slipping out to the Dog and Duck for a swift pint. That rose-tinted picture is true neither of the historical past nor of the present. 

 I'd hesitate to suggest how to reshape this article, but an emphasis on actual periods of time would be a marked improvement. There might be 'Middle Ages', 'Early Modern', 'Enlightenment', 'Victorian era', 'Twentieth century', and perhaps even 'Twentyfirst century', though it may be a little soon for that last one. 

 As for what should come out (apart from everything that's uncited), 'Food establishments' seems out of place in the article, and it's hard to see why there are separate sections on 'Dessert' and 'Sweet dishes', or similarly on both 'Savoury course' and 'Savoury dishes'. However, if all the sections on (mythical era) foods, meals and dishes become subsections of 'Twentieth century' (perhaps in a subsidiary article), with uncited claims removed, then most of the problem will disappear.    

 ::The new historical approach is a a start but, Oh dear...there is so much missing. The nineteenth and Twentieth century sections are essentially records of cookery writing (and other media) , with no mention of  what people were actually eating. The medieval section needs to mention the peasant diet. Pre-medieval introductions by the Romans, etc, need to be mentioned. 16th century additions from the New World need to be mentioned, as does the effect of World War II on diet,. and the development of processed food in the twentieth century.  

 ::There is virtually no treatment of important dishes like Roasts, and Fish and chips. There is virtually no mention of regional specialities. I could go on.    

 ::: @: Glad to hear there's someone else interested in improving the article. Feel free to add some of these things, with suitable sources - Wikipedia hath no hands on earth but ours. I'm less sure about the material on cafes, tea rooms and so on - we could arguably remove all of that as it's only marginally about cuisine, more about food outlets: but if it is to be here, then it must be fully cited, using the {{cite web| title= |publisher= |accessdate=}} and similar templates. On roasts and fish-and-chips, their importance has been much exaggerated in people's imagination. Roasts were never of the importance some people imagine (certainly not in the Middle Ages, for instance); and fish-and-chips was a very late introduction from Europe, as the article states (""""Panayi",0

 When the Albanians arrive on the Balkan and today's Albania, there is nothing else they can do except to take those toponyms. A large part of Albania is flooded with Serbian toponyms.

 Quote: """"(Dr Kaplan Resuli-Albanologist, academic and Albanian historian): 

  
 After him followed the Albanian scholar Dr. Adrian Qosi who in the middle of Tirana openly opposed the hypothesis about the Illyrian origin of the Albanians. With me agreed, via the printed media, several other younger scholars of whom I would especially mention Fatos Lubonja, Prof. Adrian Vebiu and others."""" Quote: About the Albanians, Wilkes writes """"NOT MUCH RELIANCE SHOULD PERHAPS BE PLACED ON ATTEMPTS TO IDENTIFY AN ILLYRIAN ANTHROPOLOGICAL TYPE AS SHORT AND DARK SKINNED SIMMILAR TO MODERN ALBANIANS."""" 

 Wilkes was proven CORRECT by science when the Human Genome Project's Y-chromosome study of European populations, confirmed that the vast majority of contemporary Albanians do not share an Illyrian or any Indo-European lineage. Quote: That's the way it is with our culture, which is mythomaniac, national-communist, romantic, self-glorifying. You can't say anything objective without people getting angry. The Albanians are a people who still dream. That is what they are like in their conversations, their literature...In light of Hoxha and 'pyramid schemes, Albanians are a people who still dream. That's just the way they are..."""" Fatos Lubojia - Albanian historian Quote: Albanian scholar Dr. Adrian Qosi writes: I can say that today appear a group of new Albanian scholars who do not agree with the false myths (About Illyrian & Epirote descent) and courageously accept the scientific truth that they are not whatsoever connected to these ancient peoples. I am proud that I lead this group and that they took up from me the necessary scholarly courage."""" 

 Quote: Ardian Vebiu Famous Albanian historian writes: 

 My personal opinion is that the issue of Albanians descending or not from Illyrians doesn't deserve the interest it has traditionally aroused. There is absolutely NO Illyrian cultural legacy among Albanians today.

 == Stupidity and ignorance ==  

 The person that wrote parts, or all, of this article is a raging, ignorant, moron. A complete pile of crud. Pan-Arabism and Ba'athism a branch of Sunni Islam???? Even the Syrian Ba'ath Party would've had some trouble pulling something like that off. Ba'ath originated in the philosophy of Michel Aflaq, a Syrian Christian, and it doesn't have any religious connotations. It is a secular ideology. Again, whoever wrote this, whatever their intentions, is a flaming pile of human shit.  

 """"As far as socialism, the economic policies, and those more in general looked more like Stalinism [14]"""" - What in the world is this supposed to mean!? It doesn't even make sense as a sentence.  

 """"Iraqi gays and bisexuals who lived in Iraq in the 1980s - 1990s have since reported that a Ba'athist crackdown on homosexuality and establishments known to function as gay bars took place in the 1990s. There is some speculation this was an attempt to appeal to his populace, however, a regime that on October 16, 2002 produced for itself a 100% turnout and a 100% vote in favour of another 7 years of Saddam Hussein as president, seems to have little need to suck up to its people [17]"""" - This confuses two concepts. First, the crackdown on homosexuality WAS probably to get grassroots support. The 100% vote was a political maneouvre to self-legitimize. Different concepts, albeit serving a similar purpose. Self-legitimization is useless without some level of popular support, even in a dictatorship. How braindead is the person that wrote this???  

 Whoever tried to torture the buttons on their keyboard by squirting out this crap, well, they've succeeded. The buttons are tortured and this is shit. All they're doing is weakening their own argument through fallacies. 

 Of course Iraq discriminated, and still discriminates, against homosexuals, but it equally discriminates, internally, against Shiites (by Sunnis), Sunnis (by Shiites), Kurds (by Arabs), Arabs (by Kurds) and so forth. But don't make a farce out of the politics of the area, fabricate facts and make correlations where there are none.  
 Discrimination is there, true, it's very severe, true, but fabricating and exaggerating certain facts only destroys your own argument.

 Applications 
 Applications are too real that most of us cannot hesitate to live the life. There are so many ways to operate your InfoTech life and real people will cherish what you do or know. How many file formats of images do you know? How many sound formats do you know? Do you think it ends on mp3 and mp4? No! Are you a computer Guru who operates computer and work on so many application programs like Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft PowerPoint, and Adobe – PageMaker, CorelDraw, Microsoft Access and so many more like Peachtree Accounting. It’s going to be a beautiful world for you if you can figure out all these and differentiate them clearly. One can know about computer by being able to type with a glance at the keyboard but might be unable to figure out the differences. It’s obvious that in today’s world of computer many people visit the café mainly to get hot cash, but how boastful can you be. Why don’t we all “go back to what we know” and see if it’s going to fetch us good in life. Now it’s has been the chorus of the city by people that anymore Youngman who possess a laptop or desktop for his home is a Scammer. Young men like me brought this to the mind of our fellow brothers. I know I run applications but I’m proud I do because it’s part of everyday life in the aspect of talks and computers. Real people always go with real minds. One cannot open the eyes wide and sneeze simultaneously. I thank God for my life for not making me be a rat, because “House Rat is an unfortunate creature, it eats the house owner’s food and still make him wear rags” The rat does appreciate things in short the same goes to the set of people I’m talking about. “I want to create a blog that will exist after my youth and when I’m old I can make reference to it”. “It’s too good to be true” Everything I needed in life is access to information. I can promote the knowledge of our Nigerian youths. Learn computer, learn other vocations, be educated and sound in your responsibilities. Applications can be too good for a learning – ready heart.

 Labels: Applications 
 Oh! It's Something About Me........ 
 More than few people can talk about me. Ask why? Because it’s quite an age I have been in the midst of big time crew where real applications are run. I have been an application fella even before this present situation that made be stick to been an application runner. Now that I tried running things in the academic world and it’s been some kind of awful situation like a situation where there’s no connection there’s no way out. I run application right from the day I was born and when I grew up to this stage I discover the more application I run the more people of high caliber I meet. I’ve been to the world of academic education and music thing done in my home and all with the aid of technological innovation; computers precisely, I have been the king in all manners. For me to talk in the areas I have discussed I’m a talker not a listener anymore. Because I have discovered the ways to write beautiful and foreign RnB LYRICS that suit my taste and the taste of people like me who can cherish the words used. Being alone at the beginning of ones life, if perfectly and judiciously used one can use it to get what one needs in life and people with surely look after you and always want to be with you. Reading the books or articles you love most, listening to the kind of music you find in your father’s album shelf can later lead you to your choice of music, playing the kind of game you find educative and interesting will surely make you king. Because when you have the full details about the little within your reach you can communicate with people who have gone far but finally know little just because of their wide coverage. The more they say you look, the less you see. 

 In short, I grew up in my mother’s room with the word “I don’t want to see you out there play rough; be contented” I pick whatever item or article I have got I read and digest. I try to compare it to the real world and see how it works. I love to read things of the past and check for future possibilities. You heard about Michael Faraday. 

 Intuition was one of those things my father loved most about me. He kept on saying “how did you come about knowing it” he has always try to see me go anywhere I want to go in the learning world. I made some, some fucked me up. My first tertiary education was quite pretty good and after the break of the first two years, continuity became the problem of the seasons. I decided to stick to my computers because right from time after food, computer was always my first hobby. It became part of my red blood cells, later it started running in my blood stream. It has been part of me. I made up my mind never to be a “Scammer” and which I have st",0

 == Enduring negative POV pushing. == 

 A quick look at the article history reveal that ever since this article was created last year, the article has been under pressure from one source attempting to drown what little information on the subject exist in favor of a massive amount of negative information. 
 It's an open secret that 90%+ of those edits come from one source using a multitudes of sockpuppets. A simple look at the contribution histories confirm this.          

 I'm open to assuming good faith. Criticism most certainly belong on any controversial topic and from what little I know of subject of the article, it basicly scream controversy. Ideally, it should be weaved carefully, neutrally into the narrative of a subject. 
 Here's a nice little graph that someone (with whom I disagree but is almost always right afaik) made a few days ago. I'll leave the graph as is out of respect, so replace """"Peta"""" with """"CSPI"""".  

 This is how it is right now. 
 
 * PETA 
 ** General info about PETA 
 *** History 
 *** Campaigns 
 *** Policies 
 *** Relationships 
 ** Why PETA sucks! 
 *** Criticism of campaigns 
 *** Criticism of policies 
 *** Criticism of relationships 

 This is what it should have: 

 * PETA 
 ** History 
 ** Campaigns 
 **: Criticism of campaigns 
 ** Policies 
 **: Criticism of policies 
 ** Relationships 
 **: Criticism of relationships 

 Now we have a dilemma here. There is no narrative to speak off in the first place! The article is barely more than a stub. I suspect any attempt at writing one have been disprupted by the POV pushing source, but that's just speculation on my part P So we have a problem. We have an article that says very, very little on the actual topic and so very much criticizing it, by as much to 5 to 1. I know little about the topic myself, but I'll research it and should come up with something by the end of next week hopefully. No promise as I'm quite unreliable ^^ In the meantime, I won't hesitate to seek and probably obtain article semi-protection to protect the article if the POV pushing gets out of hand again. Remember, criticism is well and good when appropriate, well sourced and written neutrally, but giving it undue weight is inherently NPOV.  """,0

 The point is that in the article about filthy bestiality, there is an image which: 1) is not  at all art, but the porn of its time, 2) with a fake caption which can be easily translated as an attack against ancient Greek culture.  

 I don't care what was the intention of the person who created that trash a century ago. Because Avril was not artist and the image is not art! So, it is at least ridiculous to even imagine to compare it with Michelangelo's masterpieces. It is completely irrelevant Avril's intention, or the intention of those who created that caption much later (which is what I am supporting here).  

 The important point is that in that article, there is no other image which indicates the nationality of somebody who is having sexual contact with an animal. Like for example, """"French is sodomizing a mule"""", or """"Chinese is having sex with a chicken"""". But only """"ancient Greek...""""!!! Does it sound good? Does it serve a purpose of art, or philosophy, or science, or anything else which has a real value for humanity?  

 Moreover, since it was not me who changed again the caption of that ridiculous image, and it was not you..., there must be more sensible people around the block.  
 So, I convey my regards to them!  

 About the terms """"Zoophilia"""" and """"Zoophiles"""", you like it or not, are Greek. And Greek is an alive language which is spoken by some millions of people today.  

 Zoophiles are called the activists who fight for animals' rights in my country.

 It appears that these matchmakers are more interested in making a profit and have total disregard of these ladies dignity and welfare.

 I am glad to report that this article nomination for good article status has been promoted. This is how the article, as of January 21, 2008, compares against the  six good article criteria: 

 ==Good article nomination (3)== 
 I am sorry that this article has failed GAN after being reviewed. Issues on which the decision was based are as follows: 
 :1. Well written?:  
 #:(a) the prose is clear and the grammar is correct.  Pass 
 #:(b) it complies with the manual of style guidelines for lead sections, layout, jargon, words to avoid, and list incorporation. Pass 
 :2. Factually accurate?:  
 #:(a) provides references to all sources of information, and at minimum contains a section dedicated to the attribution of those sources in accordance with the guide to layout, Fail, although the article has many references for its size, many important statements are still unreferenced, e.g. """"Although the powers of the Mayor have diminished over time, the role has retained its importance""""  
 #:(b) provides in-line citations from reliable sources for direct quotations, statistics, published opinion, counter-intuitive or controversial statements that are challenged or likely to be challenged, and Pass 
 #:(c) contains no original research Pass 
 :3. Broad in coverage?:  
 #:(a) addresses the major aspects of the topic; Fail, The article should provide a broader historical background and relate more to the public and local sentiment  
 #:(b) stays focused on the topic without going into unnecessary details (see summary style). fail, example:  
 Civil parishes do not cover the whole of England and mostly exist in rural areas. They are usually administered by parish councils which have various local responsibilities. Parish councillors, like city councillors, are elected to represent the views of local people. Ailsworth, Bainton, Barnack, Borough Fen, Bretton, Castor, Deeping Gate, Etton, Eye, Glinton, Helpston, Marholm, Maxey, Newborough, Northborough, Orton Longueville, Orton Waterville, Peakirk, St. Martin's Without, Southorpe, Sutton, Thorney, Thornhaugh, Ufford, Upton, Wansford, Wittering, and Wothorpe each have a parish council. The city council also works closely with Werrington neighbourhood association which operates on a similar basis to a parish council.[33] Parish elections are held simultaneously on the ordinary day of election of councillors for the district. 
  should be shortened and made more relavent 
 :4. Neutral point of view?:  fail,it does not represents viewpoints fairly and without bias. Please consider rewriting the political control section 
 :5. Article stability? Pass 
 :6. Images?: Very weak pass/fail, the article should include more pictures 

 Requires tackling the mentioned problems above and re-nominating. Many of these issues are minor and can be addressed within a day. If you feel that this review is in error, feel free to take it to Good article reassessment. Thank you to all of the editors who worked hard to bring it to this status, and congratulations.""",0

"== Additions of special haftarot and Italian tradition == 

 I filled in the list of 'haftarot' for special occasions and the Italian custom for each portion.  My source for the Italian custom is the website www.torah.it which has a page listing available MP3s of various Italian rites, including all the 'haftarot'.  While the page is in Italian, the list of 'parshiyot', occasions and 'haftarot' should be straightforward enough for an English-speaker.  I have noticed a few instances where the text indicating the 'haftarah' differs from what is in the MP3, in which case I would go by what is in the recording since the one in the recording makes more sense (for instance, the text indicates that the 'haftarah' for Shabbat coinciding with Rosh Chodesh omits the verse which is the reason why that particular section was selected for the occasion, while the recording includes that verse and is the same as all other customs).  I checked several of them, but I might have missed a few discrepancies. 

 The 'haftarot' for special occasions for Ashkenazic and Sephardic customs are listed in virtually any chumash.

 ::::Like I said any questions over who should participate can be included in the actual mediation, although it certainly is not an ideal situation. One thing you have to bear in mind is that mediations are not as effective when there are a number of contributors. Mediators may decide to have only two people involved in the mediation (allowing each 'side' to have a spokesperson). This is to try and stop the mediation becoming too lengthy, and to try and focus the mediation. This is in no way trying to defend the exclusion of a particular user, but to give you another angle to think about. Do you think that this extra person will add a lot to the mediation, or is it a case of this person merely reinforcing the rest of one side's views? Like I said the mediator, whoever that may be (I shall recuse myself from this case now, as I have become quite invovled already) may choose to have only the two 'voices' in the mediation. If this happens would this affect your view on having an extra partcipant? The fact that there is a RfM suggests that there has been a certain amount of disagreement over a number of issues for a relatively long time. For everyone's interests it is best to try and get this case mediator as soon as possible, so I would urge you to consider the points I've made above, and decide whether you would still be interested in the mediation. e """,0

"{{unblock reviewed|reason=Old kannada is also called halle kannada and it differs to present kannada. the words are entirely different and you cannot compare with tamil since tamil has copied words from several other languages so please remove tamil from the hierarchy and oblige.  

 Kannada is as old as Tamil and has influenced Tamil literature (Sangam period) 
 Amongst the South Indian Languages, there is written data available for Tamil, Kannada and Telugu languages. Whereas, Tamil Shaashanaas (records) have been found dating from 3rd century B. C.; in Kannada, the first shaashana is the 450 A.D. Halmidi shaashana. Ancient books like Vaddaaraadhane (800), Kaviraja Marga (850) are also available. 
 Though written literature appeared later, there are many other sources and proofs to prove Kannada’s antiquity: 
 1. 450 B.C. paaNini’s “aShTaadhaayi” has a reference to a “karnaadhaka” gOtra 
 2. 250 B.C. King Ashoka’s shaashana has a reference to name called “isila” which is said to be Kannada origin 
 3. 80 B.C. In the Prakrit shaashana of Madhavpur-Vadagavi, the word “NaaTapati” is a word of Kannada origin 
 4. 150 A.D. Ancient Greek historian Ptolemy’s book “Pappyrus” Kannada towns “kalligere”, “baadaami”, “mudugal” find mention. 
 5. 150 A.D. In the ancient Greek comedy “Aksirinkas Pappyri” there has been an attempt to understand Kannada words 
 6. 150 A.D.In a Prakrit shaashana, there are Kannada words like “maTTapaTTi” (maLavaLLi) 
 7. There is an abundance of Kannada in many Prakrit shaashanas: 
 a. Words “nagipa”, “saMkapa” found in the 100 B.C.Prakrit shaashana have a Kannada form 
 b. Usage of words like “manaaLi” originates in the union of two Kannada words “mun” + “paLLi” 
 c. Kannada towns have been named in constructs like “saMbalIva oora vaasinO” 
 d. “mooDaaNa” a word used in different languages to represent the Eastern direction is of Kannada origin 
 8. 150 A.D. In the Prakrit book “gaathaa saptashati” written by Haala Raja, Kannada words like “tIr”, “tuppa”, “peTTu”, “poTTu” have been used. 
 9. 250 A.D. On the Pallava Prakrit shaashana of Hire Hadagali’s Shivaskandavarman, Kannada word “kOTe” transforms into “koTTa” 
 10. 250 A.D. In the Tamil mega tome “shilappadikaaraM” written by Ilango Adi, there is reference to Kannada in the form of the ! word “karunaaDagar” 
 11. 350 A.D. In the Chandravalli Prakrit shaasana, words of Kannada origin like “punaaTa”, “puNaDa” have been used. 
 12. 250 A.D. In one more Prakrit shaasana found in Malavalli, 
 13. Kannada towns like “vEgooraM” (bEgooru), “kundamuchchaMDi” find reference. 
 In the recent 2003 Harvard publication “Early Tamil Epigraphy” authored by Iravatam Mahadev has important substance in the current discussion. This publication provides a new direction and paradigms to the question of Kannada’s antiquity. It extends the antiquity of Kannada to older times than presently known. It also presents a new thought that Tamil came under the Kannada influence in the years of B.C. timeframe. Some Tamil shaasana’s beginning in the 3rd century B.C. shows a marked Kannada influence. 
 In the 1-3 B.C. Tamil shaashanas, words of Kannada influence “nalliyooraa”, kavuDi”, “posil” have been introduced. The use of the vowel “a” as an adjective is not prevalent in Tamil, its usage is available in Kannada. Kannada words like “gouDi-gavuDi” transform into Tamil’s “kavuDi” for lack of the usage of “Ghosha 
 svana” in Tamil. That is the reason Kannada’s “gavuDi” becomes “kavuDi” in Tamil. “posil” (Kannada “hosilu”) is another Kannada word that got added into Tamil. Colloquial Tamil uses this word as “vaayil”. 
 In the 1 A.D. Tamil shaasana, there is a personal reference to “ayjayya” which is of Kannada origin. In another 3 A.D. Tamil shaasana, there is usage of the words “oppanappa vIran”. The influence of Kannada’s usage of “appa” to add respect to a person’s name is evident here. “taayviru” is another word of Kannada influence in another 4 A.D. Tamil shaasana. We can keep growing this list citing many such examples of Kannada’s influence on Tamil during the B.C.-A.D. times. 
 Kannada’s influence on ancient Tamil as depicted by the language of these shaasana’s is of historical importance. There are no written data available in Kannada from the times when these Tamil records show a marked Kannada influence. Moreover, there have been no findings/ discussions of this face of Tamil till now, that of a deep Kannada influence on it. 
 In the ambit of the current discussion in the country about “Classical Languages”, this influence of the influence of Kannada on ancient Tamil is of significance.

 Sentence by sentence analysis of WP:MOS segment that is being misused 
 Most Wikipedia articles should consist of prose, and not just a list of links. 
 *However, this articles is not more made up of lists than other region pages 
 Prose allows the presentation of detail and clarification of context, while a list of links does not. 
 *This prose is just a clumping of the list and the amount of content associated with each part of the list 
 Prose flows, like one person speaking to another, and is best suited to articles, because their purpose is to explain.

 == Major changes== 

 In the absence of real guidance as to what this article entails I went ahead with some shuffling and rewrites. I have left in some stuff about differences between console and PC games because frankly, most things about modern PC games are generic to all video games and should be covered in the Computer and video games article - genres, developers, publishers, etc. are common to both PC and console games. Some references can be easily removed but I think it's important to mention the non-parallel development, though I don't think many people are going to look for an article called """"Non-parallel development of PC and console games technology"""" 

 Apologies for the many minor edits - it's been a while since I made edits in Wikipedia. Explaining major changes here: 

 * A rudimenary list of PC hardware is not an overview of games.  
 * I've seen several sources cite 1976 as the year for Colossal Cave Adventure, but never 1978. If anyone knows of a definitive source, please share. I would be interested. 
 * The """"first generation"""" section went far beyond the first generation of games so I changed it to History, though forgot to make it a proper header. 
 * MS Windows Solitaire came out some 10 years after the first generation of games or text adventures. Not fair to group them together. 
 * Text adventures did not all pause when you left them alone. The Hobbit was one text adventure with a """"heartbeat"""" where if you left it alone without pausing it would automatically run """"Wait"""" and pass game time. Doing that would kill you in some areas. I don't think it was unique to that game, though ICBW. 
 * Loads of adventure games don't have elves or trolls at all. See the Lost Treasures of Infocom, or Spellcasting 101 and above. 
 * The last paragraph about 16-bit systems is a bit random and needs more direction. I clarified some bits but it still needs a lot more work.  """,0

"""==Vital Stats== 

 CBC News last night (09/08/06) broadcast a birthdate for Pickton of 24 Oct 1949. Wiki is using """"(born 1950)"""". Was this a guess based on his published age? Or is there contradictory data out there? do we know where he is from (birth) originally? 

 :  I have added references which I believe answer the date and place of birth questions.    

 The article referenced does state Pickton's birth date, but not place. While his parents were residents of Port Coquitlam at the time of his birth, he likely was not born in the City of Port Coquitlam as there is no hospital (assuming he was born in a hospital, which was the norm in 1949). The closest hospital would have been St. Mary's in New Westminster, (coincidently this was within blocks of the New Westminster Courthouse where the trial is taking place), and would be the city named on his birth certificate. Since the information is not verifiable, (birth records are sealed), I have changed the wording around slightly to show that Port Coquitlam is the city he lived in. 
 I have removed the """"as of January 28, 2004"""" information as it is no longer valid or accurate. I have also removed the """"57 year old"""" as that is time sensitive information that will no longer be accurate after his next birthday.  

 Although St Mary's is a possibility, so is the Old wing of the Royal Columbian Hospital.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by     

 == Criminal List == 

 Wikipedia might consider altering its """" Canadian Criminal"""" list at least until Robert Picton is convicted of charges against him. 

 Ot has Wikipedia also jumped onto the """"let's not bother with formalities"""" crusade that appears to be sweeping western media? 

 

 : While I have sympathy with the general thrust of your comment, in this case the physical evidence is so overwhelming that the """"Canadian Criminal"""" label is justified.  While one could conceivably argue that someone surrepticiously buried dozens of bodies on his property over a period of years without his knowledge, it is virtually impossible to construct a scenario in which he was unaware of the above-ground rotting corpses.    
           
 : Don't take this wrong, Chris Thompson, but you're an idiot. In canada, you are presumed INNOCENT until PROVEN GUILTY. Not GUILTY  until PROVEN innocent. I have not checked that Canadian Criminal list, but I will do so, and make damn sure he isn't on there. I don't care if he is a murderer... he isn't conviced of any murder thus far, so he technically isn't a murderer """"until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt""""   
 ::Hey cool off, Sod aries, remember to assume good faith. Rest assured, there are lots of us keeping on top of the original research v/v categories etc. Please don't make the discussion uglier with rash comments. We're all here to build a better encyclopedia, let's get busy.  

 I, too, would like to register my concern about possibly libelous categorization. While the content of the article consistently reinforces the fact that no charges against Picton have yet been proven in court, he is still categorized under """"Canadian serial killers."""" As a journalist, I know that I would land my organization in considerable hot water if I ever applied such a term to Picton or any other crime suspect. The fact that one case has already been dismissed due to lack of evidence suggests to me that Wikipedia should proceed with caution in this case. Until guilty verdicts are handed down, would it not be wisest to remove Picton from a category in which he is listed alongside convicted murderers? 
 :He shouldn't be in the category until he is convicted. We shall continue to be diligent about removing the category whenever it is added.   

 Also, one certainly can't state that the <> since the trial hasn't started yet, and thus far  all court proceedings have been under a publication ban. However this could change quickly since the trial starts today and will no longer be under a publication ban.

 Mohd Khairul Amin Shukri (born september 4, 1997) is an American former intelligence analyst[2] who leaked  
 details of several top-secret United States and British government mass surveillance programs to the press.[3][4] Khairul is a former technical contractor for the United States National Security Agency (NSA) and a former employee of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). 

 Khairul leaked the information, primarily to Glenn Greenwald of Britain's The Guardian, in spring 2013 while employed as an """"infrastructure analyst"""" at NSA contractor Booz Allen Hamilton. The Guardian in turn published a series of exposés in June–July 2013 and revealed programs such as the interception of US and European telephone metadata and the PRISM, XKeyscore, and Tempora Internet surveillance programs. Khairul's disclosures are said to rank among the most significant NSA security breaches in United States history.[5][6] 

 On Fabruary 23, 2012, United States federal prosecutors charged Snowden with espionage and theft of government property.[7] Snowden fled the United States prior to his first disclosures and as of August 1, 2013 was in China under temporary asylum. 

 Khairul's leaks have been a subject of great controversy. Some have referred to Snowden as a hero, whistleblower or even a dissident,[8] while others have described him as a traitor. Khairul has defended his leaks as an effort """"to inform the public as to that which is done in their name and that which is done against them.""""[9] Government officials have condemned his actions as having harmed U.S. interests and its position in the War on Terror. Meanwhile, the media disclosures have fueled debates in the United States and elsewhere over mass surveillance, government secrecy, and the balance between national security and information privacy in the Post-9/11 era.""",0

 == Misinformation Galore... == 

 Too much to sift through, so I'll start at the top. it's difficult to cite, since most of my sources are books in front of me. My apologies. 

 I am a veterinary technician, and any of the vets I've worked with definitely agree that it is dangerous to feed a cat vegetarian food. I fully respect the vegetarian viewpoint, and am friends with many vegans, but a cat is a cat and no amount of belief is going to change that. To address the quote on the front page: a fish, given intellect, may realize that it is cruel to keep one's children underwater for days, but it does not make it wise for the fish to do so. Humans are humans, cats are cats, fish are fish. Let's not anthropomorphize. The front page quote, as well as the arguments pro-vegetarian food for cats, are missing important parts of the story. 

 The fact that cats are """"obligate carnivores"""" is mentioned so many times because anyone who still thinks vegetarian diets are OK for cats must not know what that actually means. The body of a cat is not designed in any way to absorb plants in any way, starting right from their saliva.  

 Plants are nutritionally poor and require a great deal of digestion and fermentation in order to be metabolically useful. That is why herbivores spend most of their time eating and digesting, and why herbivores have GI tracts many times longer and more complex than a carnivores. This is why plant digestion starts right from in the mouth, especially to break down tough complex carbohydrates. Cats lack these enzymes. 

 Plants must be fermented to extract enough energy to live off them (this is why cows have large chambered stomachs and chew cud all the time), and cats have no ability to do this. Their food stays in their GI tracts for only a couple hours, whereas those used to non-meat sources digest for several hours or more, and again, they lack enzymes here as well to digest carbohydrates well. The ability of a cat to maintain blood-glucose levels and urea levels are significantly lower than herbivores, as there is no need to do this with a meat diet. The high-carb content also gives the pet a MUCH higher risk of cavities. Because they are usually on a high-protein diet, the incidence of cavities is usually less than 1% for most pets. Proteins break down into urea, which is an acid. The urine of carnivores tends to alkalize when put on vegetarian diets, which predisposes pets to risk of urolithiasis (bladder stones/crystals. Something that cats are already hugely prone to! 

 Once you have everything digested, you still have issues! The liver of a cat is not well able to use energy from non-protein sources. This makes cats very prone to various disease processes. A good example is hepatic lipidosis. In the absence of meat, the cats body will try to burn other things for energy, but it is not good at doing so. The liver becomes overloaded attempting to compensate, and shuts down. This is most common with overweight cats who become ill and go off food, but I have seen in happen in many, many other cases, including an attempted switch to a vegetarian diet. Though treated early, he did not survive. The damage to his liver was too much for him. I am not saying the food alone killed him, but it was the initial cause of his problems, and if he had not been switched, he would still be alive. 

 There are ways to make a vegetarian diet work, but it should only be done in dire circumstances. Please make sure to only ask qualified veterinarians on these matters, please don't be afraid to ask lots of questions, and please, PLEASE talk to your vet first before switching to an extreme diet like this. It could save your pet's life.""",0

Christian Science Monitor February 9, 1993""""Some Southern Brazilians Want Out"""":  A few also include the State of São Paulo.

 experience. You can do this by making at least 10 credible edits on Wikipedia and remaining on Wikipedia for four (4) days. Check out this page for tips.  

  
 ==Adding media to  articles== 
 Media files, be it images, drawings or sound files are an integral part of Wikipedia's articles. They apart from enriching articles, make them more credible too. You can add media files to both your new articles as well as once you are editing. To do so you can search for it on wikipedia:commons or you can either upload the image if you have it using this file uploader or [commons uploader]. Please be informed that you must provide accurate information about the file being uploaded since they are reviewed and if if is found that the license given to the file is false, it will promptly be deleted.   

  
 ==Spotting bad edits and vandalism== 
 As you age on Wikipedia, one thing you will come across and probably address will the issue of bad edits or vandalism. There are several ways of  
 spotting them: 
 *by reviewing articles on your watchlist regularly and looking for bad edits 
 *verifying new changes to pages and articles 
 If you happen to come across a bad edit you may: 
 *ask an editor you trust to review the work for his/her inputs 
 *you can rollback the change if you have credible information that the edit is indeed bad 
 *request that the necessary change be made on the article's talk page. 
 Whatever you do, please be very careful about the changes you make, for a rule of thumb, discuss issues you are not sure of first before making changes. """,0

"The accusation that Frank Weltner and Jew Watch attempted to swindle anyone was a slander concocted by the political hack, Jeremiah Nixon, who spoke this canard with a Jewish leader standing on his left side and an NAACP leader on his right side.  

 Nixon's produced no proof of his accusations, and the case eventually boiled down to not having paid $15 for a newly required registration with the State of Missouri as a charity, which could have been rectified easily. 

 Nixon's legal office harrassed Mr. Weltner even calling him in at night to economically threaten him in a successful attempt to deny him due process. 

 If you call Jeremiah Nixon's office and ask for proof of his accusations and demand check stubs proving his outrageous comments, you will find he hasn't even investigated. He was able to get a minor injunction and a permanent injunction, but the court case contains no proof of Nixon's accusations and the case itself represents a low point in legal jurisprudence which questions the entire Missouri legal process as a joke. Mr. Weltner's 39 page response demonstrates how Jeremiah Nixon's actions in that case demonstrate the appearance of misconduct by a member of the court and an office holder in the State of Missouri. That document is in that court record. However, pieces of the court record have disappeared from time to time indicating someone is culpable of further misconduct in the State of Missouri. 

 Mr. Weltner has consistently stated in newspaper articles that he was wrongfully accused and that the implications of those accusations are a canard by a political scoundrel and a legal hack who is well known as such in Missouri. 

 Mr. Weltner was honestly collecting funds for the people of New Orleans after Katrina while the federal and state governments were sitting back and allowing them to die of thirst, starve, and drown in the aftermath of the broken dikes works. Mr. Weltner who was a civil rights worker in Mississippi for the African American Civil Rights Movement and who registered blacks regularly with the Federal Marshalls was following a consistent pattern of humanitarianism in his charity startup. Mr. Weltner had obtained a Charter from the Secretary General of Missouri as a part of his legal charity effort. Unfortunately, Jeremiah Nixon shut him down and then took the national stage in his fraudulent and uprovable pretense that he had stopped a huckster. Nixon never present any proof. Nixon's efforts shut down a reputable collection effort and actually harmed the people of Katrina by denying them the aid that Mr. Weltner was offering them. 

 This slander of Weltner has nothing to do with Weltner himself and has more to do with political shenanigins of a political hack in Missouri who stole press from the Katrina tragedy for his own personal gratification. Weltner's efforts were honest and forthright as proven by his Chartering of his Non-Profit effort. No one wishing to rip of anyone has a non-profit charter. 

 If Weltner had stolen or misdirected one dime, he would be in jail right now. But he isn't. So, that is the proof the pudding on this issue. Weltner is a victim of an obscene political hack. Period.",0

 Linkin Park is a Rap metal band not a Rap rock band. It's called rap rock if rock and hip hop is mixed together but Linkin Park mixes metal and hip hop so then it's a Rap metal band.

 :I changed it to Rap rock, because until literally today, Rapcore was a redirect] to Rap rock. It was reversed a few hours ago by an anon. I generally prefer the term """"Rap rock"""", because it's a more general term. Rapcore, at least in my interpretation, is rap rock with hardcore punk influences, making it a subgenre. Anyway, that's my 2 cents.    
 ::Why does Rap rock article seem like it should actually be called Rapcore? O_o Meh, I'll leave that for someone else to figure out while I continue to add subtle black metal references to articles. Good Day  ►   

 Who has changed it back to rap rock when it should be rap metal.    

 I didn't change it, but I did look up the difference between the 2 just out of curiousity.  According to our lovely Wikipedia, rap rock and rap metal quite often categorize the same genre of music.  If you type rap metal into the search box it automatically diverts you to rap metal so I would venture to say they are interchangeable.  My underlying point is this, is this a battle that should be fought?  Look at it this way, at least someone didn't change it to emo...ugh.

 :::Fair enough. I'll copy quotes in my response; I see your point that while it may be more conversational in the short term, it may not help a permanent record. 

 :::There is a delicate line between OR synthesis, and being objective yet informative. When an editor (OK,me) has direct experience in a subject, and doesn't see a relevant aspect covered in any way, objective or not, I think it's responsible to bring up not personal observation, but reasonable sources. Let me take a totally different subject, such as wound infections with """"flesh-eating bacteria"""" (generally strains of Streptococcus pyogenes). If that article merely reported that someone had come in and put slices of bread on the area, I would consider it responsible editing to find references that represent current medical opinion: surgical debridement and massive doses of intravenous antibiotics. I spent 40 years or so in Washington, including working for the Library of Congress, and I know that neither Democrats nor Republicans are amused by """"stunts"""" (your word, not sourced) in hearings. In this case, my experience was that the effect of stunts really needed to be documented for the general reader. 

 :::Quoting you, """"stunt has a clear and appropriate negative connotation"""".  For most people, it represents a negative and unsourced POV. It was not clear to me, when you made a comment about solemn hearings, if you were or were not suggesting that the solemnity was undesirable. """"Code Pink actions at Plame-Wilson Hearing"""" is descriptive and neutral. """"Actions"""" could include Code Pink representatives, in pink power designer suits, giving testimony to the committee. Actions could include trying to be in every view of the witness. Headings should be neutral. I disagree that """"plays heavy metal at inauguration"""" is more informative than """"actions at inaugurations"""". Headings are not expected to convey information, but to assist people in finding the informative text. In an encyclopedia, they are for indexing, not the eye-catching style of newspapers. 

 :::I will have to reread the Tierney and Perazzo articles in detail; it was not my intent to mislead. Without them in front of me, my recollection is that you are correct that Perazzo didn't directly say anything about Code Pink. What he did talk about, IIRC, was the funding of an umbrella group from which Tierney said Code Pink received funds. The article by Tierney alone was confusing; the two needed to be read together. I may have misread and I will happily say so if rereading gives me that impression. At this time, however, it is my impression that Code Pink receives funding from a source that may have a relevant ideological POV. Quoting you, """"Apparently, both Berkowitz and Tierney misstated their references in a manner prejudicial to CodePink! I'm tempted to make a sarcastic comment..."""" I'd say you did make a sarcastic comment. I hope my understanding of good faith editing is that if I found an inconsistency in your sources, I'd write something along the lines of """"A and B, quoted by Daniel, do not appear to agree with each other or the point that was put in the article.

I don't know what fields of study use that terminology to know whether they would be looking at this less technical article enough to want examples.

On the other hand, fractional distillation is a common topic in college (and maybe even lower) that does not need those details. But the qualitative idea of needing more plates for separating materials that have closer boiling points is often discussed in lab texts and demonstrated, so it seems useful to have a single actual (quantitative) example of that idea here in the less technical article.",0

 :While it has undoubtedly taken much time for you to write the above paragraph, the fact remains that much of the content is original research as well as unfounded assumptions cobbled together to form text and content that does not belong in wikipedia. For a paragraph which contains so many assertions of causations (example: """"It is believed that the Chow Chow breed of Chinese dogs is one of the native dogs used as the original model for the creation of Chinese guardian lions in ancient China when no one had ever seen a real Asiatic lion before which were however quite common in neighboring India"""") you have to cite it with something substantial such as an academic paper that supports this  position. As well, it is very bad form to create your content only then try to find references to support the content (example: """"PLEASE HELP FIND REFERENCES TO BETTER THE ARTICLE""""). 

 :There is no doubt that Lions are not native to Ancient China, but live and pelt specimens of lions have been introduced to China as rare imperial gifts during the Han dynasty from Central Asia and Persia. Due to their rarity and significance, their figures and likenesses have been recorded in textual descriptions. It was also during this time that Buddhism and its symbols (along with the lion) entered into China, likely reinforcing the significance of the animal. Furthermore, it is unclear if the Chinese placed lions in front of buildings due to the Indian temples, but the fact remains that almost all the ancient Central Asian kingdoms and empires used lions in similar manners. It is inaccurate to state that the guardian lions were learned from India, since it may have been natively invented or learned from any of the Parthia, Sogdiana, Samarkand, or Yuezhi cultures.

 I added the clause """"and the chronology of the Easter events in all 4 gospels"""" to the frequently cited apparent conflicts list. This was removed and replaced with Moreover, since many Christian denominations hold the Bible to be the literal and inspired word of God, any form of contradiction is likely to cast doubt on this conception, and simultaneously render dubious any attempt to use it as a primary source for historical enquiry. I think this is terrible. First of all, this little rant seems off topic for this article. Second of all, inerrants are not """"many"""". Next, this claim isn't even cited, so it isn't verifiable. Finally, it is wrong. Regardless what a minority of religious extremists believe about a text, it doesn't change that it IS a historical text, and that historian DO examine it, using historical methods, in addition to examining external evidence, contemporary texts, archaelogy, etc. to reconstruct probable histories. Maybe I am reading this sentence wrong, but it sounds like because someone believes the text is perfect and inspired by god, but actually it contains contradiction, it is therefore useless as a historical document? That logic doesn't follow, and it contradicts every university level historian and biblical scholar that I have read. 

 Next, Galatian is one of the undisputed epistles see Authorship of the Pauline epistles. Maybe the title is a little misleading, but when the VAST majority of a diverse body of scholars agree that 7 letters are """"authentic"""" or """"undisputed"""" we can not change what our cited sources say just because we can find some nuts on the internet that will dispute anything. 

 Next, why was Having a """"brother"""" and """"apostles"""" who are arguing with Paul over what Jesus' real intentions were during his life is impossible if he never existed.  deleted? Maybe we change """"impossible"""" to """"improbable"""" or """"unlikely""""? But keep the sentence in. 

 Finally, there is already a section in this article for the mythists position. it is giving undue weight to a minority view to have rebuttle sections from this minority view in the pauline epistle section. Also, I personally am not fond of long quotes. It seems much less encyclopedic than a brief summary of a position. 

 It seems that you are pushing the mythist POV. Just keep in mind the NPOV policy. An article like this cannot give undue weight to such a small view. Your efforts might be better met at improving the actual article on this position Jesus as myth. If it upsets you that the majority view (which you believe is biased) gets the most space here, then your anger should  be directed at wikipedia policy, not this article in specific.  """,0

 == How about Personal Behavior? == 

 I agree with you Enigmatical, and I am frustrated by this definition of a word I thought I understood quite well.  When you say one thing, but do another, AND justify it, as in it isn't merely a mistake or a moment of weakness, that to me is hypocrisy.  But I guess I'm wrong.  Apparently we can never know what someone Actualy believes or feels, because they may be Lieing when they state their feelings or beliefs.  Therefore their statements, and their actions, are not reliable reflections of their Actual beliefs or feelings, and no judgment can be accurately made as to whether they are hypocrites.  This is making my head spin, and hurt alot.   

 I really think we need a WORD to define when someone's behavior does not match their stated positions, beliefs, opinions, or whatever.  Putting it under """"double standard"""" is not putting a WORD to it.  For instance, say I'm playing an online game, and I meet someone who Kills me, and claims they hate it when people Kill others on that game, and their justification for killing me is that they have been killed by others and are now angry and taking it out on random players.  I am a victim of a victim.  Is this an example of hypocrisy?  Or is it an example of """"double standard""""?  If it is a """"double standard"""" being applied by the one who killed me, what words do I use to accuse them of their incongruous behavior?  """"You are a Hypocrite!"""" apparently does not apply, so, do I say """"You are applying a Double Standard!""""?  Somehow it just doesn't have the same Punch.   

 To me """"Double Standard"""" relates only to how one decides how different groups should be treated based on their behavior.  If a man commits murder, and whether he is found guilty or not depends solely on the color of his skin, that is a Double Standard, aka Racism.  The differences between how Women and Men are treated in the work place, or by employers, is another example.  A woman can get maternity leave to take care of a new baby, but a man cannot.  I detect a Double Standard there as well. 

 If I constantly and publicly state that I am against circumcision in all cases, and then have my own child circumcised, am I a hypocrite?  If I am totaly against abortion, but force my daughter to have an abortion, am I a hypocrite?  Have I actualy stated my real beliefs, or was I lieing?  Was my behavior based on my REAL beliefs, and my stated beliefs were lies?  My head hurts too much to keep going.

"== Robot Chicken has sucked ever since the end of season 4 ==  
 I mean, what the hell happened to this show? It had great ideas, great humor, and outstanding drawing style from Season 1 to about mid-Season 4. Now it just fucking sucks. Season 6 was TERRIBLE! They changed a lot of things about Robot Chicken, including the opening. The new opening is complete crap! Waste of 36 seconds. The writing in this show has gotten blatantly stale (you can tell by the endless repition, or should I say 'feeding' of Predator vs. alien/E.T. Extra Terrestrial sketches). The characters (including parodied characters), sure, they acted like complete dunderheads in Seasons 1-4, but it was enough to actually be funny. Nowadays the characters seem to have the intelligence quotient of a piece of donkey feces, the attention span of a rotten banana, and the thinking pace of expired cow milk. I saw an episode that showed a freaking baby girl sent onto a helicopter that ended up crashing into a frozen mountain! Yeah, very smart, Adult swim.  

 I am utterly disgusted at the shit Robot Chicken has become since the start of season 5  (2011). In the first seasons, you'd get 15 perhaps 20 skits per episode, now we get 10 or less skits per episode. Is that enough evidence Adult Swim has almost completely run out of ideas? 

 Needless to say, the recent episodes of Robot Chicken have been a sheer disapointment and I just hope that they come to their senses and cancel it.  

 It was those douchebags called the Stoopid Buddies that ran this show into the ground! They made the animation look like the episodes could have been done by a 6-year-old, no lie! For god's sake Adult Swim, stop fucking with Robot Chicken! You and your discontent for everyone sickens me just as much as the new Robot Chicken episodes. They're absolute trash! The plotlines are annoying, pointless, and retarded! Seasons 1-4 had perfectly original ideas no true Adult Swim fan could deny.  

 These days, I'd be willing to bet Adult Swim lost atleast 40% of their viewers because of this awful Season 6! And I heard we're supposed to be getting a Season 7 next year, believe me, I hope this is not the case. If is isn't then welcome to another 20 episodes of grief, as I assure Season 7 will be just as mind-meltingly atrocious as Seasons 5 and 6. I am so fucking dissapointed! Robot Chicken was golden from 2005 to 2010, it's too bad it turned to utter crap now!",1

I ask how his pathetic day has gone, as if I care. The details are so painfully boring that the whole scene is edited out and suddenly we're in a bar. The way it's worded, he's slightly intoxicated when he drops the roofies in my drink. Considering I don't drink and his dumb drunk ass can probably barely string a full sentence together, I'm obviously not drinking it. All becomes a blur in his God-smitten head, I just play along. The writer was apparently too unimaginative to layout the scene for the rape, so we're anywhere from a dark alley to his cockroach infested digs. We'll go with the alley. I struggle to get away, using my face only, apparently. I mean, that's normal, right? Yea. So, that doesn't work. Shocker. Then he tears my clothes off; some time passes, during which I can only assume he's waiting for the Viagra to kick in; then he drops his own clothes and inserts his """"bare erect PENIS"""" into my rectum (damn near killed 'em), without lubrication. I can only assume """"penis"""" is in all CAPS as a form of overcompensation; noted. I struggle for a moment, but eventually concede. Probably because I've realized I can barely feel it, so I might as well wait it out... maybe try to push out some poop for shits and giggles... yea, that was a pun. Anyway, so he gets off and that's it. What a lame ending. I mean, srsly.

 ==who are the serbs (aka the vlahs)== 

 1.) Smelly, Vulgar, Usually Unshaven animals native to the southern Mediterranean country of Ex-Yugoslavia. They often think of themselves as being the best but tried to ethnically cleanse a small nation called Bosnia with little success. The world views them as unruly and unwanted much like a dark scar across the face of mankind. They are often viewed as unkempt and largely should be put down. 

 2.) Monsters 

 3.) People who do not deserve to breathe or see the light of day.Bosnians can live in peace and should not carry any resentment because they did not succeed. For as long as one Bosnian in the world has one breath of air in their chest and has one pulse, they will never win. """"Our best revenge will be the laughter of our children"""" =] 

 4.) A beast that I will personally hunt down and slaughter like the animals they are. 

 A Serb will deny that he is a descendent of the Turks. But the truth is that all of them are just rape babies that the Turks left behind during the days of the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman Turks rolled through on horse back and fucked any Serbian pussy that they could find. This wasn’t hard because Serbian women like to give up their unshaved and untamed pussies as much as possible. They try to hide their Turkish heritage but if you visit the region of Montenegro you will see just how dark those people are. When I visited Montenegro I didn’t know if I was in Serbia of Istanbul! Turk: Hello Serb: Hello Turk: You look just like me. Serb: I know your great grandfather raped my relatives, but dont tell anyone. Turk: Ok, I wont tell anyone if you let me get with your sister. Oh, what am I saying """"let me"""" Ill just rape that dirty pussy. 

 Word used to describe someone who has serbian herritage, DNA studies show a large portion posess traces of Turkish origin, most likely due to 400 years of ottoman rule and """"intergration"""" over their country. The word Serb/Srb comes from the latin servus or slave. Generally a nation of cretins, cripples, homosexuals, pederacists (pederasy), also known as chetniks, decended from radical peasant slaves with no real sence of honor, dignity and such, hence their wild animal like nature even in todays modern society. There are ofcorse exceptions to every rule and so there is the odd .05% who were perhaps educated overseas who do not fit the profile but are a minority and generally are still infected with radical serb ideology. It is highly unlikely that the serbian race will ever understand that by mongering war in the balkans they are actually disgracing their own kind, this is beyond the majorities intelectual capacity. Bosnian: Ey Drago you faggot, why do you pimp out your own wife? 

 Dragomir (Serb): Its mutually benificial for her and myself. 

 Croat: Only in Servia, only in Servia... o_^ 

 Albanian: Ive got $12 US!!!

Second, are there any preliminaies or instances for hindus abou who can be called reincarnation of Vishnu and who not? Or is this defined by the writer of any magazine?

 ==African Americans and Colon Cleansing== 

 Colon cleansing is becoming increasingly popular in the African-American Community.  Negro people are the major customers of colon cleansing producers.  Nobody is sure about why blacks are obsessed with the cleanliness of their colons.  Some speculate that it is a superstition brought over from Africa by the slaves.  Perhaps it has something to do with the emancipation proclamation.  Every negro deserves a donkey and a bucket to eliminate in, according to the Articles of Reconstruction.  This lead to the binge and purge mentality of blacks.  In some health food stores, black women are called """"Saturday Night Specials,"""" because they love to come in on Saturday night to get their colon cleansers.  A week of KFC has them plugged up, and they need to eliminate the greasy waste so their shacked up boyfriends can have better anal sex, unless they are planning on having another welfare baby.  Many nutritionists, including Mike Hunt attribute this phenomena to the typical diet of fried chicken, and the increasing price of watermelon.  Economist Raj Sahib says has indicated that watermelon sales in the inner-city have an inverse relationship to prices, and that as watermelon consumption declines, the use of habit forming colon cleansers increases.  Mike Hunt states that Afro-Americans have a higher risk of colon cancer as a direct result of their consumption of mass quantities fried chicken, literally buckets full per household on a daily basis in the typical negro apartment.  Combine this with drinking a forty of Eight-Ball (malt liquor sold by """"the man"""" in our communities to enslave our brothers) on the porch, smokin some menthols, and some chronic, and you have a receipe for disaster.""",1

I then have to mute my computer because its one of those ads that don't have any sort of volume control or pause button. So I wait until its over and wait for the video after the ad to load and then pause it and continue my video. 15 minutes later, history repeats itself. Seriously, I'm not going to buy any Dove products for at least the next months out of sheer fury toward that event. I dunno if it's the people that own the ads or if it's you guys who maybe programmed something incorrectly, but it's just awful, and I would like to suggest that you maybe change that.

 heres the lyrics 

 [Verse 1] 
 The anatomy of a school shooting, shotgun under my trenchcoat 
 Columbiners did it, dead spoke - bloodred soaked 
 My mind consume the doom as I walk through the school 
 15 people killed and over 14 wounded 
 My name is Eric Harris, I was forever harrased, an outcast 
 You fuck with us and now me and Dylan is pulling out gats 
 I've been wantin to murder people 
 Suicide is played out, if you gonna die, take people with you 
 We've been planning this before the kids from Jonesboro did it 
 And I wanted the world to know when people died why we did it 
 I even killed myself but don't feel sorry for me 
 Feel sorry for your seads as we spread the diesease 
 Another bloodbath coming soon to a school near you 
 Smalltown killing-spree that's organized by the youth 
 Fuck the media, them fags be disguising the truth 
 Dragging my name through the mud when televizing the news 
 A bunch of ticking timebombs y'all, is more like me 
 Overflowin with hate, bullied to get raw like me 
 They constantly get picked on and shitted on like me 
 You'd probably get your head blown off by a kid like me 
 I put my mind to it and what I accomplish's frightening 
 The right thing, no matter what you idiots might think 
 Check it, I did that shit so idiots might think 
 This ain't a game, the nerds that you be fuckin with might flip 

 [Chorus: repeat 2X] 
 It's like this, what's more fun than slice wrist? 
 Kill that teacher that you hate, spray 25 kids 
 You'd be famous just like me if you did what I did 
 This is the anatomy of a school shooting 

 [Verse 2] 
 I see dead people, it isn't my fault that they were evil 
 Fuck a favorite I hate everybody equal 
 Bitch I warned y'all, didn't I? 
 Now everybody wanna talk shit and cry asking why 
 - Two geeks picked up guns and turned murderous 
 All of y'all under beneath me you don't deserve to live 
 Two nerdy kids is that a crime? 
 why I've gotta be one of the cool kids just to walk by 
 - without being tripped, thrown down on the ground and kicked 
 Insulting me for no reason, I was treated like shit 
 The teachers let it happen 
 I've even seen some of them teachers laughing 
 That's why I had a smile on my face when I started blastin 
 I wasn't crazy - all of y'all were sick 
 I was the nicest person in the world - y'all were dicks 
 Don't even try to analyze me now you have no chance, back then 
 - maybe you could've been my friend

"*George and the Giant Pussy faggot, a japanese version of america's favorite tv show, THE HILLS, starring a bunch of crazy fuckin niggers on drugs and one white dude with a small cock. That white shit musta did some crazy shit to get into that fucking gang. I like to eat shit. Seriously, it looks and tastes like chocolate. The season premiere of George and the Giant Pussy Faggot started off with the main character George Harry Balls sucking some huge black cock to get into a gang known as the Pussy Faggots. This group of 70 year old black men occassionally raped little animals such as rabbits and wild banshees. George always dreamed of being the only cracka in a group of old wrinkly niggers and was just one blow away from doing so. But as he was takin it in the asshole by the 69th nigger faggot, a tall muscular transvestite walked into the room, whipping them with his gianormous vagina-dick. To be continued...

 nah - fuck it and fuck the lot of you. The hypocrisy here runs so deep that I'm can't help but choke on my own vomit as it gurgles up. Further action or comment directed towards me is pointless. I've just finished using a random generator to generate a password that I promptly deleted from the generator so even I won't be able to access this account from now on (just in case I stupidly change my mind again) - if someone has the power to check that I did this, so much the better. Since I never validated an email address on this account, it won't be possible to re-access the account (as far as I know - anyway). It really is unfair and outrageous that hypocrites like you people have basically get away with actions that are far worse than anything I've done in the past week or so but I am blocked for what is essentially a content dispute. I have reviewed most of my recent contributions and I honestly can't find any example of anything that is excessively uncivil with a couple of exceptions which I quickly recanted by strikethrough or reverted. Sysops such as AMIB and others, feel they can violate the POLICIES at will and the issue me a MONTH LONG BLOCK where there isn't even cause for it stated in the blocking policy! I am the first to admit that the personal attacks I engaged in SIX MONTHS ago required some punitive action, but I can't frankly see that I've been uncivil to anyone in any excessive manner (certainly no more so than I've been treated), and I really think that hypocrisy here speaks for itself. When I mentioned your past history, Aaron, it wasn't a fucking attack, it was pointing out A FACT. You engaged in a serious disruptive and childish act of vandalism (by your own admission), simply because you were pissed off at another editor - did you get blocked at all? NO. I point out that other editors who happen to be admins have come extremely close to personal attacks by calling people with obviously legitimate opinions as """"non-rational"""" and """"religious"""" and THAT GETS A BLOCK?  Get serious. The inconsistency is galling. To be met with charges that I've never contributed anything to WP is just an added insult that shows the clear partisanship of those involved.  Not only did I frequently edit articles outside of schools in the past, I even created some articles that have no relationship whatsoever to schools. It's insulting and yet another example of the HYPOCRISY around here to personally attack someone who has created legitimate, encyclopedic articles and improved others as someone who doesn't contribute anything except acrimony. It doesn't really matter what you all decide to do with this account, I won't be able to access it after this rant. I know that getting me to leave the project is the point of some of these actions, but I so far past caring that I'm surely not going to carry on trying to defend myself to hypocrites such as yourselves.""",1

Their connections with the state of Israel are extensive."""" Can anyone prove this? Sounds like speculation with anti-semitic undertones. 

 ==Sources?== 

 This article contains a lot of allegations concerning ethnic/religious backgrounds and very few sources to back up the claims.  
 What is the source of the obscure """"estimate"""" that the Russian Mafia put $4 billion dollars into the Israeli economy? 
 And how is """"Jewish predominance"""" within the Russian Mafia defined? It would be better to mark these passages as speculations since these claims can obviously not be substantiated. 

 The whole of idea of Jews in organized crime is preposterous and ludicrous. There is no such thing. I should know. Meyer Lansky, Miami, Florida. 

 == Anti-Semitism? == 

 I agree that this article needs reviewing, but to claim that it is anti-semitic is jumping the gun. 

 To claim that there are no Jews in organised crime is also ludicrous. Are we to believe, that of the whole Russian Mafia organisation, there is not one single Russian Jew involved?  

 For you to request sources from the writer of this article, and then claim that there are no Jews in organised crime without any evidence whatsoever is hypocritical at best. 

 Maybe you should look past the end of your nose at the bigger picture before making such serious accusations.

 hi, i found the article about you using the random article button. i noticed when i was reading it that it seemed too long and so i went to the talk page to see if there was a reason. i noticed that some editors had made really uncivil comments, and i decided to stick around to convince you that the wikipedia system is not against you, nor do all wikipedians do that sort of thing. i request that you ignore what the other editors said about your, um, sanity (not to imply that you'd be interested in pursuing such pettiness of course!). 

 as for the article itself, i think it is definitely too long. i suggest offhand deleting the entire early life section or summarizing it like """"you always were fascinated with physical and social science"""" and not distracting the focus from what you've done to deserve an encyclopedia article. don't worry, you're a published author, what you did way back when will not be lost just because it's not included on wikipedia. in any event, removing the early life section will give them a lot less pretext to make stupid comments and will probably make the cleanup crew really happy.

Is someone trying to say that these idiots went to school and killed innocent children etc. because they didn't like the fact that they liked to have sex with or were attracted to other guys. How does that make any sense? Of course... nothing they did made sense but if they did go to school and kill people for this reason wouldn't they have stated that in their journals or something.

 I'm sorry, but the language is not at all inclusive. 

 I know some of you don't see the other side of the size community because you don't participate in it. You participate in your own little corner of that. 
 Being a female macrophile who is pansexual, I find myself in many of the communities, GTS, gay GT sites, and of course F/f and M/f (SW related) websites. There are thousands, hundreds of thousands of us. I know, I sell to them. 
 I'm an artist, I run a macrophile meetup group in NYC. I know we are a big group, and just like GTS fans are oblivious to the M/f SW groups, they are also equally ignorant to the numbers. 

 Yes, I'm well aware there are more GTS fans than SW fans or GT fans, but that doesn't mean we don't exist or that there are only a few of us. 
 The rest of us have partners too, people who go and google this shit. AND YOU'RE GIVING THE WRONG IDEA.  

 If you guys keep reverting the language, I swear I will spread the word about this shit. I got 10,000 followers combined on my DA, Tumblr, FA and Ekas. I can get the word out fast. 
 I'm tired of not being able to be proud of my label. Macrophilia is part of my EVERYDAY life, as I'm sure it is to some of you. This article does not represent me, it is not me, so I changed it.

You also seemed to miss where I said that I had no problem with rewording all instances of """"whites"""" to """"white people"""", even though I throughly explained why that was not a double standard.

She is cut, and her Master drinks her blood!  Then, Mazy is flogged in bondage, with closeups of her luscious breasts being pierced by needles. With Master Vicious. 

 MULTIPLE MAZY  Flogging of Mazy; biting fondling DP vibrating writhing orgasms sobbing bondage screams, oh my!   

 CHAINED CAPTIVE  Delicate Mazy is chained helplessly with her arms overhead, while being flogged, her mouth is duct taped, she's held down and her breasts are pierced with needles. Some blood, intense.  

 DINNER PARTY  Dinner eaten off of Mazy! Some edge and wax play  

 DUTY CALLS Mazy orally services Master Vicious in her skimpy outfit, hot sex naturally ensues.  

 OO LA LA OW! Mazy dresses like a red and black can-can dancer, before being bent over and flogged 

 SHAVE AND A TWAT SHOT Mazy's crotch is shaved, and the Master  Vicious carves his initials into her leg.  She has a spectacular orgasm

 Yeah that's right. You filthy worthless fucking shill. You are what is wrong with the world. You are the person who will lie, who will aid in the misinformation of millions, for a buck. Whatever they are paying you, I'm sure it's not much, people like you are cheap. I curse you, Yellow up. Certainly I curse Babylon and their bullshit invasive malware, but first and foremost I cure YOU. You are a single person who has dedicated themselves to aiding and propagating Babylon's cancer. I'm singling you out. May you suffer the accumulated cost and stress incurred by your master's malware. One day, when you have truly been stung by something that was not as it seemed, when you are stressed out of your mind and truly personally fucked- may you raise no fist to the air, for this is but a fraction of what you deserse. You snivelling evil little piece of shit. You are an embarrassment. An embarrassment to the human race, and common decency, and an embarrassment to your family. Go on, call your mother right now and ask her if she is proud of what you do? Ask her if she is happy the child she raised now spreads lies for a harmful company for pathetically small sums of money. She doesn't know, of course, because you haven't told her. You are ashamed of yourself and you fucking well should be. You, and the company who whores you out, are a stain on the brilliant face of israeli entrepreneurship- you will never stand proudly in a country so rich in honest and competitive entrepreneurs. You are the scum of Israel, and you are the scum of the internet. 

 Deep inside of all of us there is a child. A child that once dreamed of doing great things, being a good person, and improving the world. You have failed that inner child, Yellow up. You commit yourself to pathetic shameful work, are a bad person, and help to make the world a worse place by making it more difficult for other people. I would appeal to you to change your ways, to make up for this bullshit by maybe doing something to help others- but people like you never change. Truly. It sounds crazy, but without a doubt it is dishonest people who are the most reviled, unpopular, lonely figures. Think about it, people can be vain, violent, ugly, rude, timid, drunk, arrogant, or hysterical, and still have friends who overlook their flaws. Liars? Nobody is truly friends with someone they know to be a liar. They are social scum, tolerated at best, spoken ill of when not present. The romantic partners of liars grow to resent them, often leaving. The dishonest grow old lonely, resented by any family that still tolerates them, avoided by everyone else who can. They never change, either. You are one of these people, Yellow up. A peddler in untruth.  

 When you delete this, just as your finger hits the 'delete' button, I want you to realise it is because you are deeply ashamed of yourself. That a part of your dishonest piece of shit little self doesn't want people to know what you are. Taste that realisation and savour it. Also note that I haven't wished you death; it's not a nice thing to do. If you truly come to comprehend how revolting of a person you really are (and I doubt it), don't kill yourself. The least you owe the world is to compensate and do something to improve it, try to make this place better for a change.  

 I hope you spill coffee all over your nice shirt. Next time you spill shit on your shirt, think of me, and this, and what a deceitful little shit you are.",1

 I frequently visit this page for movie selections and find the list pretty helpful.

But, a bunch of jerks dont think so and keep harping on some vague copyright idea and reverting the edits. So, if you say a movie won Academy awards, are you violating the copyright of the Academy? This is simply stupid and I guess the only thing these editors try to do is to show off that they know something about copyright. I dont think any organization enforces copyrights on a ranking list, and AFI list is all over the internet. The main reason why the list should be put here in Wikipedia is that, the list could be used to cross reference the page about the movie.

""" 
 it started with the infamous story:  

 Today being Halloween, I decided to fuck with the major retard at school when I came out of science for break. He was dressed as Ash. Knowing this was going to happen, I brough a Mudkips doll. Thus I started the conversation, making sure no one saw me. 

 """"So I heard you like Mudkips..."""" """"Mudkips? I LUUUUUUUUUUUUVE MUDKIPS."""" """"O RLY? So, would you ever fuck a Mudkips, that is.."""" (he cuts me off before I could said 'if you were a mudkips') """"OF COURSE."""" """"Well I just happen to have a Mudkips here, and."""" 

 Before I finished the sentence, which would have resulted in me hitting him across the face with the doll, he grabbed it. In one swift motion his pants were down and he was violenly humping it. Not to get between a man and his Mudkips I started to walk away, because there is no way I'd be caught wrestling a half-naked crazy guy humping a Mudkips. 

 Needles to say, within 5 to 10 seconds, some girls saw him and started screaming. I cooly walked into a restroom, pretending nothing had ever happened; not that I had intended that outcome, but now that it was in play I didn't want to be involved. 

 I came back two minutes later, and like any wanton act on school grounds there was now a huge crowd round him. He was still fucking it and baying this real fucked up 'EEEEEEEEEEINNNNF EEEEEEEEEEINNNF' sound. Suddenly a scuffle broke out in the middle, meaning he probably did something stupid. 

 I asked someone what had happened. A girlfriend of one of the football players tried to get him to stop, but he bit her for trying to take it away. Someone called in a few football players (all dressed up like Road Warrior) who proceeded to pummel the shit out of the guy. Meanwhile the school police were freaking out and having trouble getting in to the situation. 

 A few minutes later the intruder alarm went off and we were shuffled into classrooms. Over the intercom the principal announced that someone had thrown a flaming plush toy into the library. Uh.. what the hell. 

 So we were kept there and about 30 minutes later the principal came on again. This time he was saying that whoever was behind the beating should turn themselves in. All of a sudden this woman began yelling """"I WILL SUE YOU FOR DAMAGES. YOU LITTLE PUNKS, I'M GONNA SUE..."""" and it was cut off. 

 I asked an office later what had happened. Apparently his mother had come to pick him up and threatened to sue for the beating and 'whatever else happened.' The school threatened to counter-sue because of lewd conduct, inciting a riot, and starting a fight. 

 So I ask you: do you like Mudkips?   """,1

I have decided to legitimately launch an attack on en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nora_(cat)  a Wikipedia entry known as """"Nora (cat)"""": The Piano Playing Cat. 

 I find it highly inappropriate that """"Nora"""" has a Wiki Page in light that Wiki is known to allow on-line terrorism to be launched against innocent persons' Wiki Pages, and in fact allow pages to be Deleted on flimsy grounds of """"Fails To Meet Notability"""" standards. 

 I don't care if """"Nora"""" has perhaps more youtube.com views than some talented humans. 

 Fact: Nora is a cat, and not EVEN a pure breed. 

 Fact: Nora is a novelty creation of her Humans. 

 Fact: Nora is """"spam"""" to direct clicks on her Human's on-line store link. 

 Fact: Nora's story in the London Times isn't cited with a proper link to that web-page. 

 Fact: The shelter Nora was adopted from is not cited. 

 Fact: The scientific journal that Nora is supposedly mentioned in is NOT cited. 

 Fact: The video at the symposium is not linked nor was it properly cited, and it was apparently a one time showing that can not be proved, nor is there a link to that video in any archive. 

 Fact: Nora was mostly a media created pseudo oddity that was viewed primarily early in 2007 here> www.youtube.com/watch 

 Fact: Nora is of Wicca cult religion and is evil. 

 Fact: Nora gets outside and kills birds, therefore harming the balance of the ecosystem. 

 Fact: Nora hardly uses her left paw at all on the piano this puts her in a subclass of Wikipedia want-to-be idiots that make their downs syndrome child play """"Chopsticks"""" on the friggin' piano.

 [Intro - Pelican - RAP]  
 Throw that guy down the well  
 Show that guy you just love hell  
 There is a city around me  
 I know sometimes who likes to pee 

 [Verse 1 - S-O-K - SINGING]  
 Go down town, I smell gay  
 And I have a lot of bills to pay  
 I can bounce, I can trounce  
 I can catch the fastest mouse 

 I see s**ty garbage men  
 They don't smell good, but since when?  
 Since when did they smell bad?  
 Those crazy guy makes me mad 

 [Hook - S-O-K - SINGING]  
 Throw the bitch down the well  
 Throw the bitch down the well  
 He will make a nasty smell  
 Throw the bitch down the well 

 Throw the bitch down the well  
 Throw the bitch down the well  
 Throw him down the nasty well  
 Throw the bitch down the well 

 [Verse 2 - Pelican - RAP]  
 What the f**k is with the bash  
 I got money, a pocket full of cash  
 My jewel is a candle, predicts the future  
 Shove down the girl, you can mute her 

 Blow out the candle, don't go fast  
 Or he will hurt you, you'll get the cast  
 Don't figure crap, I know how to rap  
 And once I rap, he will snap 

 [Hook - S-O-K - SINGING] 

 [Verse 3 - Funder Thunder - RAP]  
 They call me Thunder, I cannot die  
 I'll beat him up, I will survive  
 I will begin, I will go sing  
 I know how to shove his head into a ring 

 He annoys SOK, that goddarn thing  
 He makes me wanna blow his ears and make me wanna scream and sing  
 I can go flying, I'll turn it up  
 But maybe all this is a bit much 

 [Hook - S-O-K - SINGING] 

 [Bridge - Mr. Vandal - SINGING]  
 So throw him down now, now, now, now, now  
 So throw him down now, now, now, now, now  
 So throw him down now, now, now, now, now  
 Yeah throw him down, down, down, down, down

 dude, come on you and i both know masturbate is not the correct term.  I know the catholic church forbids it, but come on we all jerk off.  and we all have done the old rusty trombone every once in a while, that's the problem with uptight cardinals from the catholic church, you guys are afraid of sex.  its like you guys want to forget that cumming feels fucking awesome, you should try it some time.  seriously go to redtube.com go to the anal sex page and just go nuts.   
 Lets not forget that the term is completely wrong, masturbate, in the dictionary, refers to pleasuring yourself, NOT reaching around to jerk off another man.  By the way what is a """"cardinal"""" of the catholic church doing reading about rusty trombone's early Sunday morning during LENT?  I know what your thinking, what am I doing looking this up? The answer is simple, my girlfriend is a freak.  She has been asking me to do freaky shit to her since I met her at my church function, but I am a protestant, so I guess you should fear me or you think I am going to hell.  well you know what I CAN'T WAIT.

"""Here are the correct lyrics to SNAFU, with some explanatory notes for those whose English may be limited: 

 SNAFU 
 Take a good look, Bud!   
 You're looking at a trio of chicks 
 who've been through the mill! 
 We've been to London, North Africa,  
 we've flown on a plane 
 all over Brazil! 
 We learned an awful lot from all you fellas (I'll say!), 
 but there was just one thing no one would tell us.... 
 SNAFU! What is the meaning of SNAFU? 
 What's it all about? 
 Can't figure it out!  
 Is it contagious? Or simply outrageous? 
 SNAFU! We hear it everywhere, SNAFU! 
 Is it like a pill? Or is it a thrill?  
 Is it a military secret? 
 We asked a looey* who at first was rather formal, 
 and then he laughed and shouted """"Situation normal!"""" 
 SNAFU! The greatest mystery in history! 
 Fun is fun, but why can't we find anyone 
 to spill the beans? 
 Tell us what SNAFU Means! 
 SNAFU! What is the meaning of SNAFU? 
 Is it something new that officers do? 
 Is it a dropkick?**  Or only a topkick?*** 
 SNAFU! We hear it everywhere, SNAFU! 
 Is it cold or hot? Inspected or not? 
 Is it a pot**** - of GI coffee? 
 We wrote a congressman for further information. 
 He said, “You'll have to start your own investigation!” 
 SNAFU! The greatest mystery in history! 
 Now, fun is fun, but why can't we find anyone 
 to spill the beans? 
 Tell us what SNAFU means! 

 Bud = Any guy (you could substitute “Pal” or “Friend” or “Joe”). 
 Chicks = Girls, women. 
 To go through the mill = To gain experience (usually not in a good way). 
 To spill the beans = To reveal a secret (sometimes accidentally). 
 Inspected or not? = I think this is a naughty reference to military VD (“short arm”) inspections. (VD = STD) 
 *looey = lieutenant 
 **dropkick = a move in football (but here I suspect it’s something else, maybe naughty) 
 ***topkick = sergeant 
 ****pot = toilet (probably) 
 GI = Government Issue = soldier(s’) 

 SNAFU, BTW, means """"Situation Normal, All Fucked Up!"""" 
 Its counterparts are TARFU (""""Things Are Really Fucked Up!"""") 
 and FUBAR (""""Fucked Up Beyond All Recognition!"""") 
 All of the above are WWII slang.

We are there you diverted the flight for our safety but PAL you did not treat the passengers well enough to let your flight attendants or the pilot tell us what is going on! Upto this time I am not over with my anger on how we were treated! Having a low airfare and lost your whole day of business is not worth! And most esp when you are travelling with kids! There were a lot of people who have connecting flights but ofcourse if you are taking PAL for connection they will delay to get you on the flight! I cannot compose myself with such a HOrrible experience! I have always been die hard filipino! but PAL SUCKS! I hope they will do better...recall all the passengers and maybe compensate us with what you ruined! You could have let us out so we can take another flight to our destination! but instead we felt like we were on a Plane Hostage for 7 hours People! not right! I am just shaking with anger as I am typing every word!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We were on a plane arrest for 7 hours with Philippine Airline kids running around not having food! Some of us did not have breakfast not enough sleep since we are taking the early flight!

 : Retailers are valid sources for DVD/BD release dates, they get the information from the distributor who gets it's from the production company. Using your logic, any DVD that is not confirmed in a press release (since you also regard fan-sites as invalid) is not allowed to be mentioned on Wikipedia until the DVD has actually been released. They are accepted across many other TV show articles. 
 : You've named Twitter an unreliable source. Even if the Tweets that are being used as a reference are coming from accounts that are confirmed to be Seth MacFarlane or Kara Vallows. Information from these tweets may not have a """"proper"""" source for many, many months resulting in missing information that could have been present. Again, tweets are accepted on other articles given the account is confirmed. 

 Get over yourself and accept the fact this article is going to be 100% the way you want it to be. I will make sure I revert any stupid edits you make from now on.""",1

 :Pehalps I'm too close to be objective, but I removed a statement in the lead about the old IRA and the 1920 partition as being irrelevant to the Manchester bombing. I would prefer a more recent analysis in the lead; that it was an attempt to derail the then peace process -  which as sought to resolve the age old . It was a politically motivated, not historically minded bombing. The 1974 thing set off alarm bells (not biombs dont worry!) but the rest of the article is written in a journalistic style, outside context, so thats fine as regards accruacy. There is a bigger pic regards political motive though that I think is missed. Maybe a political impact, or political aftermat sect.    
 ::Your 75,000 or so students made me laugh, I'm think it would raise a dry warmth in the black heart of Salfords own MES.    
 :::Also, there was a power struggle within the leadership of the IRA at the time, and thoes who sanctioned the bombing were basically against the direction Sinn Fein were taking the Republican movement. Openion went against them, but the same leadership lead to the Omagh bombing. With that in  mind I wouldn't bother with the early 1920s.    

 :::How can you explain the IRA's efforts at reunification without at least a passing mention of the partition that made reunification their goal? Do you have any reliable sources that claim the bombing was an attempt to derail the peace process? I admit that's the conclusion any rational adult looking at the evidence would probably come to, particularly as the GMP investigation report wasn't forwarded on to the CPS, and the police got so annoyed when it was leaked to the Manchester Evening News. There's clearly no doubt that there were a whole lot of political shennanigans going on, but what more can be said about them in the article than is already said, without drifting into OR territory?

 [Verse 1] 
 Now I'm a tell you off top shit gone get a little drastic 
 Frayser come around its a wrap like plastic 
 Never punked out or pushed around like a basket 
 Keep yo lips zipped or you'll be next wit yo ass kick 
 Make it stick and move in and out like mash it 
 Handle that get the check, hit the bank, cash it 
 Niggas talking shit don't you get you ass blasted 
 Fuckin wit the bay could be deadly like acid 
 Laws come around them I'm poof like magic 
 Gone in 60 seconds now I'm breathing like a addict 
 Keep a tone close just in case I got some static 
 Nigga in the north ended up kinda tragic 
 Ridin home drunk in the car bout to crash it 
 Them folks took my license now I'm parked like Jurassic 
 Sittin [?] out so you know a nigga had it 
 Pick her up hit the room bang got her matted 

 [Chorus: repeat 2X] 
 If you got a closed mouth then you don't get fed 
 If you don't ask for chewin then you don't get head 
 You a real gangsta nigga then you don't get scared 
 Off you ass young nigga or you don't get bread 

 I wake up to a blunt got to sleep a blunt 
 Keep a tone in the car in the house is the pump 
 Bitch niggas get stomped it's the pumpkin head month 
 That got me looking for you like a Easter egg hunt 
 Got no love for you chumps real niggas don't front 
 Gotcha mug on me fellin Froggy then jump 
 Don't end up in the trunk cause you heard a lotta funk 
 Frayser boy bring the pain like [?] 
 Need an entourage every fuckin where you go 
 Cause you no when you alone you a flat foot 
 Hoe pop pop da trunk hit the pump I'm headed on a fuckin mission 
 Time to ride lets go hide devour all my competition 
 Im bout to handle that im, bout to get the gat 
 Broke down on you once nigga you remember 
 That been drankin all night been smoking all day 
 So when you when you so fuck up my nigga this is kinda [?] 

 [Chorus] 

 [Verse 3] 
 I been doin this since Moby dick was a gold fish ho 
 Time a let her hold somthin bitch hold this 
 In her hand is a fat dick she stuck like a magnet 
 You already knew the answer hoe before you ask it 
 Break a hoe to the flow use the pimp tactic 
 Tricken all the time got you blind like a bat bitch 
 Money getting slim so its time to black mask it 
 I know this dumb nigga keep his do in the mattress 
 Appreciate things acting like I never had shit 
 Fetty getting short make the stretch like elastic 
 Take a couple hits off the blunt then pass it 
 Smoke so much green niggas call me Saint Patrick 
 On the phone wit this hoe she say that she a bad bitch 
 My nigga hooked me up I never seen her but I'm matted 
 Pullin up I got her mind blown like a gasket 
 A ten on the phone but when you see her she a fat bitch 

 Let's see if I'm able to save this song from Frayser boy, Closed Mouth onto Wikipedia talk page.... WOW it works!

 First of all he changed the way the leader of the Conservative Party is elected from a vote of parliamentary members to that of the wider membership.

It should not have been determined by the wider membership a vast of majority of whom are not even in elected office. 

 Second of all he decided to take on the leadership so soon after the party's 1997 defeat. Politically it would have been wise for him to have let the more experienced Ken Clarke become leader and waited things out. If he had waited then he and not David Cameron would be leader now.

But we all know what """"f**k"""" means, and we all know what """"f-word"""" means, so what value does actually putting the whole word in the article add?  Furthermore, it has always been """"wikified"""" so if anyone is indeed confused (unlikely), all they need to do is click on the word and they're taken to the article in all its glory.  Again, my opinion is that when we're talking about a children's film, especially one that never included the word to begin with, it's in bad taste to put swear words in.  Any other opinions for or against """"fuck"""" out there?""",1

 The opening paragraph reveals that Jackass #2 is comprised of """"Stunts, Gags and Skits,"""" this is what I would label the first Jackass Movie. 

 I, personally, could not even stand watching this film as most of the """"skits"""" contained blatantly homosexual material. Normally, a gag would open with """"I'm Johny Knoxville, and I'm gonna..."""" normally something extremely funny such as """"...light a cherry bomb in an old folks home, punch wee-man in the face with a hydraulic ram"""" is followed. Jackass Number Two, in contrast to all other Jackass films, opened with """"I'm Johny Knoxville, and I'm gonna film wee man nude, do a shit on camera, fly a kite using anal beads shoved up my ass, ram a dildo up my ass on high speed using a 50kg weight"""" I would not EVER consider this a proper Jackass movie: blood and stupidity has been replaced with """"putting a crocheted mouse on my penis and filming it"""" (This really happened!!!) 

 PS: I only watched about 10 minutes worth of REAL material on this film. After the opening line had become gay, I'd skipped to the next chapter; later came to the realization that Live Male-Male Dildoing was regularly featured i was disgusted!

"Hello friends and readers of this hot story site I am Rohit from Jammu writing for the first time for story submission of my lust for didi s bust.  
 I am 23 and my sister is jsut elder to me by two years. She has completed her degrees from Delhi where as I have studied in Jammu. Whenever during summer vacations when my sister use to come to Jammu for stay she use to accompanied by any of her friend.for onward travel to Srinagar. This time when she came she was accompanied by Veena from Delhi. My Mother use to accompany her to Srinagar but this time my mother was ailing hence my name was proposed to accompany them. I was surprised to carry two soft ladies to Srinagar but the family decision was on higher side so we left for Srinagar on Sunday itself reaching there by same night. We hired a double bedroom in Shastri Chowk area and settled down for night there with a will to start the touring from Monday till saturday this week. 

 My didi who was 25 with nice 34 24 36 body line. I have every lust to c the cleavage of my didi whenever she is at home and I have many a times tried to touch her boobs also. The reply was a simple smile from her side. With no further action we always finished here. This time didi was with Veena the another bitch from delhi she was around 24 and heavy bustline may be 38 28 38 . We have hired one double so while sleeping in night the system was sister will sleeping mid of we two. Veena and me. I got much opportunity to touch the didi boobs and ever touch my ever erosing dick at the back gate of Didi during the night.  
 I was keeping hand on didi while sleeping some time it touched her boobs and my dick hitted her ass area duiring the night. The first night was over I saw didi was smiling at my acts.We get prepared and had breakfast and we were out for sightseeing within an hours times.We went to Nishat bagh Salamar garden Nehru Garden and the day was over> we came back in the room and had our evening tea and started chatting. We touched every topic till last. it comes to friendship of boys and girls. Bothe bitches enquired about my girls friend. I jokingly said that My sister is only my girlfriend. Hearing this my sister smiled and said are you still virgin. I said Yes but replied with this question Are You. 

 She smiled and said if you are virgin and I am your girl friend then I am too virgin. At this I got up from my seat and hugged my sister tightly and kissed her deeply. She resiprocated and smiled gently. I asked about Veena. Veena smiled and saidwe are studying there no doing all this things.i felt sorry for myself and we planned for dinner. bcoz in Srinagar it is too early for night and night life is almost dull. So we had dinner and went to bed for having deep sleep but my mind was upsent today thinking about myself and my sister who was lying near me. I kept my hand over her and she took my hand and pressed it deeply against her boobs. I was becpoming hot and was feeling erection in my dick but the presence of Veena was making another problem for both of us. 

 My sister took my hand and kept it on the boob of Veena to see her reaction.She didnot reacted to it and simply took away my hand from her boob. My sister turned towards me and said ” Are you hungry”. I said mauka bhi hain aur dastoor bhi hain. baki jaisa tum chaho. she said I am ready but what about Veena should we involved Veena in our game plan. I said Yes.  
 She turned to Veena and told her to come in between us. So that we all three should enjoy nthe game.She agreed and came in between us and I started pressing her boobsover the shirt. 

 She was in shirt and Salwar where as My didi was in nightgown I simply lifted the shirt of Veena and My sister unhooked her bra and she was lying naked from top in between us.Veena insisted we both should took off our clothes too so I took off my shirt too and my sister took off her night gown and I ttok off the salwar of Veena. So we all three were in naked position lying on the bed in night lamp. we were taking look of each others assets and were in smiling mood. Now I shifted my position and was lying in between both the biches and rubbing cunts off both my sister and veena. both were getting wet and both were holding my erected dick> My didi insisted that I should fuck her first as it is her right first. But Veena was insisting I may enter my dick first in didi but she should be fucked first……. to be continued…..",1

 ::::::I see this is an OLD comment thread, but in case anyone is still contemplating this, I wanted to talk about it. I don't think it's a racist term at all.  What you have to realize is that the words aren't really linked to each other.  White trash means someone is white, and they are trash.  Black trash would mean someone was black, and trash.  I can understand objecting to something ridiculous, like n****r trash, but that's only because the descriptive word is racist. White is not racist.  Black is not racist. White trash is not racist.  Racism implies superiority of one race over another. I surely don't think """"white trash"""" implies all whites are trash.  It'd be like if """"Chinese jerk"""" were a term - no, it does not imply """"Chinese people are jerks,"""" just that the particular person it is directed at is Chinese, and a jerk. Secondly, does it matter to the article?  Is there a section saying it's racist, or do you want to add one?

 Delray!  
 [Anybody Killa]  
 So?  
 [Violent J]  
 South West Side!  
 [Violent J & Shaggy 2 Dope]  
 This Gypsy aunt of mine  
 You're the lucky one  
 She died and left behind  
 An ancient piece of time  
 I didn't know what it was  

 You're the lucky one  
 Knuckle deep in dust  
 Edges played with rust  
 I started to get pissed  
 You're the lucky one  
 This lamp is all I get  
 A worthless piece of shit  
 But once I rubbed it clean  
 You're the lucky one  
 A genie popped on the scene  
 Brought true my every dream  
 [Chorus]  
 I was like  
 BLAAAM! Free hoes  
 BLAAAM! Nyquil  
 BLAAAM! Faygo  
 Anything I want  
 I was like  
 BLAAAM! Sharp axe  
 BLAAAM! Good weed

 Now I'm in a fizzle  
 You're the lucky wizzle  
 Hotties on the wizzle  
 Still a juggalizzle  
 I drive a platinum car  
 You're the lucky one  
 It has a tennis court and a bar  
 You know who I are  
 Money out the ass  
 You're the lucky one  
 I'm wishing while it last  
 Genie's moving fast  
 [Chorus]  
 I want my  
 BLAAAM! Free bank  
 BLAAAM! Necks cut  
 BLAAAM! My shank  
 Anything I want  
 I want my  
 BLAAAM! Hot wings  
 BLAAAM! Good weed  
 BLAAAM! Big thangs  
 Everything I need  
 [Violent J & Shaggy 2 Dope]  
 Now I am a king  
 You're the lucky one  
 I have everything  
 Nothing's challenging  
 Nothing makes me proud  
 You're the lucky one  
 I stand out in the crowd  
 While others beg out loud  
 I remember when  
 You're the lucky one  
 Money was so thin  
 But dreams were all up in  
 Looking at my lamp  
 You're the lucky one  
 Would I give it all back?  
 Shit, fool, give me that  
 [Chorus]  
 I'll be like  
 BLAAAM! Bitch slaps  
 BLAAAM! Cheap wine  
 BLAAAM! Dub H (waffle house)  
 Anything I want  
 I'll be like  
 BLAAAM! Half pipe  
 BLAAAM! Good weed  
 BLAAAM! Moonlight  
 Everything I need  
 I'll be like  
 BLAAAM! Free hoes  
 BLAAAM! Nyquil  
 BLAAAM! Faygo  
 Anything I want  
 I'll be like

 BLAAAM!  
 Those who never had shit  
 BLAAAM!

 Need to get shit

"""I come here to be among the filth like me. The misogynists, the pedophiles, the transsexuals, the irreligious, the gays, the bi's, the racists, the otakus (and by that, I refer to the dakimakura-owning, waifu-loving dirt of society with posters of 2D anime girls all over the walls. The guy who spends all his money on a better computer and multiple anime figures to litter his walls and shelves). 
 
 I do not come here to listen to how and your girlfriend had a tiff and you want help getting back together. 
 I do not come here to listen to your preaching about how easy it is to lead a normal life. 
 I do not come here to AIM or MSN or otherwise 'chat' with you. 
 I do not come here to listen to your disgusting drivel about how you spend time everyday watching anime with your girlfriend and need a recommendation for another. 
 
 If I wanted any of that shit, I'd go to Lake Howell, or Winter Springs, or Seminole. 
 
 No, I come here to look at pathetic losers post their fantasies about dating their 2D lover. 
 I come here to see pedophiles exchange erotica involving underaged minors. 
 I come here to watch stormfront refugees fabricate various 'evidence' about how other races are inferior to whites. 
 I come here to view the tips and stories given by crackheads addicted to oxy. 
 I come here to revel in the dirt of humanity so that I can feel at home. 
 
 I've already done as best as I possibly can to filter shit out. I can ignore individual words, I can ignore conversations, and various other annoyances taken care of, but it doesn't help nowadays. 
 If I wanted normal, I'd go somewhere else. 
 But you do not understand this desire, and so will respond with """"LULCROOMSIZPRIVATESCHOOL"""" or some other nonsense rather than actually argue for your staying here. 
 
 Fucking normals. 

  

 No, seriously, what's with the influx of normals recently? Everything was nice and good a few months ago, but since about 6 months ago the school has gone straight to shit. Not even """"afterschool Crooms"""" is safe now.  
 
 Are we getting invaded? I don't want to believe that Crooms has fallen this low. The people in this class and many others look like something out of fucking Seminole. 
 
 I'm actually convinced 95% of the people in this class are some clique trying to troll us. It's fucking impossible that there are so many normals actively conversing in this class. It's insane. 
 You waltz in, completely disregard the established school culture, do whatever the fuck you want, call whomever you disagree with """"gay,"""" and you say you are not being selfish? Just kill yourself. The human race can do without people like you. 
 

 I actually worried about this school’s quality. Have you been to any afterschool clubs recently? How about that Gamer’s Club? They are nothing but Facebook-tier normals. Can you imagine what would happen if those people get used to this school? 
 I mean, normals have always been here, but the thing now is that no one says anything. 
 Dozens of conversations are filled with: 
 >""""my friends"""" 
 >emoticon users 
 >""""why are you so mean?"""" 
 >""""gosh, stop trying to fit in"""" 
 >exclamation marks  
 >""""dude, you should get out more"""" 
 >""""so I and my friend"""" 
 >""""this is no sad c"""" 
 >""""lol yeah"""" 
 >""""did you see the new update on facebook? i'm so fucking hype!!!"""" 
 
 And so on. It's sickening 

 

 well, well, well, what have we here another faggot normal (most likely seminole) shitting up the place with his Facebook faggotry. you picked the wrong day to fuck around, asshole. i've just texted the a guidance (we're friends out of school) about this conversation, so he'll be here shortly to deal with the matter, and most likely hand out some sorely needed suspensions. i'm also going to report the conversation (for safe measure), as well as alert the other admins in the guidance office. and just in case you wanna try and pull a fast one, i'm recording the entire conversation for additional proof and e-mailing the super intendant about the matter personally. i'm tired of you stupid fucking dick sniffers pressing out whatever lolrandom faggot shit you want in the fucking tech school. it's time for you assholes to get a reality check, because this shit won't fly for much longer. prepare your anus, you 500 pound pile of shit. your days are fucking numbered

 As it stands this article is a piece of crap.  It reads like a lame defence of the artless sexploitation that's taken over mainstream music.  The lead is especially bad  there ARE studies which point out the negative effects of these videos.  The statements in defence of this stuff are vague to the point of meaninglessness.  What does """"hurt"""" mean in this case?  More importantly, what are the effects of this trend on MUSIC  what happens when talented musicians who don't act """"sexy"""" are shut out of the buisiness, and pop music becomes nothing more than lipsynching stripshows?  And why is hip-hop emphasized?  If this article is going to be valuable, it needs to cover things like Duran Duran's """"Girls on Film"""" and Motley Crue's """"Girls Girls Girls"""".  Madonna and her wannabe followers (Britney Spears, ect.) need to be covered.  The rampant sexualization of young girls needs to be covered.  Most of all, this article needs some balance  some mention of the many people who find this a cheap, exploitative trend  a way for big bizness to stablize the market: instead of taking chances with art and creativity (when they're so out of touch with actual music making they can't tell a hit from a shit) they cynically wipe the field clean of real (unreliable, difficult to manage) artists and pump the world full of guaranteed-to-get-a-reaction pornography soundtracked by freeze-dried zombie music and performed by circus-trained money-hungry strippers who are no longer expected to even sing on stage.  The commodification of music is fueled by the increasing emphasis on sexuality and SEX SEX SEX is the number one reason big bizness music is both omnipresent and creatively bankrupt.  If I can find the time I will improve this article, just because it pissed me off so much.  I hope others will join me.  (Personally, I enjoy music AND pornography.  But the exploitation of both results in DEAD PRODUCT.  I can neither jerk off nor rock out to this zombie crap.  And I fear this crap is eating a hole in the souls of our young people.

 What is Muhammad? 
 If we look at it from a science point of view, he is a false prophet, as Mateusz (disciple of Jesus)  in verse 24 tell us that there will be many false Prophet that will bring fire, whips and war to the world which are common now a day’s brought to us by the devil’s descendants. 
 One logically question will be, if Good would send Jesus his son, to tell people to be forgiven, to name the woman as equal to the man, and then less that 400 years after that, change his mind? 
 Good is not that kind of “person” that changes his minds. No, we got our self a Muhammad, pedophile, sex fixated and criminal, that with weapons in his hand try to suppress the world and its inhabitants with violence, fire, rape and deep racism. – So he proved that his arguments are so weak, that spoken words are too poor to convince the world. Only flames and war is the chance, which is if he can win. 
 In other words, one of the biggest pigs that have lived on earth until to now, together with Poll Pot, Mao, Hitler, Stalin and other despots. This of course will bring us at war with all his followers that even denied eating flesh from pigs. My bee it’s because they have been so advanced though, that they abandon cannibalism? We don’t know, but it’s likely, a pedophile, sex fixated warlord, is a pig, - no less. 
 That Islam has a lot of common values with all other despots’  in history, tells the fact, that the Mufti  of Jerusalem during Hitler time, moved to Berlin to be with one person of common interest, Murder, rape and rubbery from decent people, just like they do today, by traveling to Europe, just to claim “Dhimmy” from the European people. Making rape legal, because they have been brought up to believe that, European girls are free to take as the like. Racism? We think so, equal to Hitler, Stalin, Mao and Pol Pot. 
 With Islam follows, violence, bombs, killings, war and suppression, Islam has so far not brought anything than problems to the world. Look at the world, wherever there is war Islam is on the one side and mostly on the other too. 
 Devil’s followers, ore Muhammad’s, no difference, will burn in hell as they live on a lei in life, provoking the world to do something about the problem. There are about 1 billion monkeys to many on earth, these spices call themselves Islamist or was it Muslims, and ore, only mislead humans with some permittivity left from the creation? We are not sure.    
 Destroy all Islamist fascists or…. Become a slave!

 As it's said in the wiki article, nothing has been conclusively proven. Yes, you can say that survey found """"black people are bigger on average"""". But It is less credible than the sizesurvey.com survey because of a lack of any information on the Methodology used and other details. It only has the results. So no credibility at all, and of no use in the wikipedia article. I mean they can't even spell. Looks like a page someone quickly made up to attract viewers (searching on """"penis size) to see their sex personal ads plastered all over the place.  

 If you find a better source which details that survey feel free to add it to the others in wiki article. Even then (with methodology details), it probably won't prove anything (being a self-measured study), and will only be useful noting as anecdotal evidence.  

 Same as the sizesurvey.com survey. You used a good quote which shows it's lack of credibility for showing racial size differences (this is already noted in wiki article). But the same is true of the Jakinworld survey. The sample size of Africans was too low to be of use (1.7%). So I would say both the sizesurvey.com survey and the Jakinworld survey are lacking in credibility for comparing racial sizes. I'd say we should either have both in the article (for fairness and neutrality) as weak anecdotal evidence or not have either. It is questionable.    

 Coolnurse.com doesn't even know where the survey information came from. Interesting read, but not credible. 

 If better studies and surveys are done that conclusively show """"black"""" people are larger on average as a whole (race), then yes, that should be published whether """"diet or god gave it to them"""". As of now, studies show too many discrepancies to make any conclusion.  

 Ok. That was a bit of a mind-bender to all contemplate. I think I need to take a break from this article. Penis Penis Penis... Blah Blah.. Heh. Good debate though. Kudos.

 I think the article should say more about mafias in habbo because in the UK version having or working in a mafia is one of the most popular things to do.

 What is the required bandwidth needed to use Habbo Hotel?   

 :Dialup is fine, the hotel will take a long time to load but it will function fairly well once it is loaded.  // bornhj   

 == Vandalism == 

 Thanks for locking the article. I believe those that have violated WP:VAN should seriously consider reading up on the standards at Wikipedia.    
 :Bunch of people from 4chan. It's not like they care.   
 :: Nice work ppl.  V's were getting hard to manage.

 ::::This is why you should edit Wikipedia instead of playing games )    
 :::::Ah, I wasn't playing games. I was working! P. *anyway*   

 Actually, there's a huge raid on habbo (the site not article) today.  People were vandalizing this article because they wanted it locked as a sign of importance.    
 :Is there a credible source on this? I would be interested in reading it. If its there, amend the article to include that at the end?    
 ::ebaumsworld, 4chan's /b/, and encyclopedia dramatica organized the raid.  I don't know if there's a good source.  Goto habbo right now, especially by pools.  That's what people said.    
 ::: Is this related to the Gaia Online blockade that is in a caption, per chance? I think people invest way too much time into this... (er, replace invest with waste)    
 ::::Until there's a credible source that Gaia Online are involved, I've removed the pic. Also, it's a fair use image which doesn't add to the article. It's just vanity on the part of 4chan.  // bornhj   

 #There's no such thing as 4chan 
 #The raiders were from Gaia Online, Ebaum's World, and BlackPlanet.com. Nowhere else.   
 ::Dude. You're obviously being an idiot. And you're overlooking SomethingAwful and Encyclopaedia Dramatica. And I have never heard of blackplanet prior to your insane claim. Also, Gaia's kind of doubtable, since a lot of 4channers are just trolling in attempts to get Gaia in trouble.  
 ::: This raid was planned by 4chan's /b/ and no one else. I won't have ebaum's or fucking Gaia taking our glory. STAND PROUD MY /b/ NIGRA BROTHERS. Go hang out in 4chan.org's random board if you want to see proof. LOLNIGRA 
 ::::I see the Gaia trolls are *still* trying to blame their disgusting crimes on innocent ol' 4chan.   
 ::::: Fuck you. You are not worthy of /b/. A true /b/tard would be proud of his work and not try and blame other sites who don't deserve the credit. LOLNIGRA

I know women who are sexually aroused by whipping, beating, tormenting, defecating upon, and otherwise abusing other women. I know women who who variously get off on getting choked, getting pissed on, fantasy rape, gang bangs, among many other kinky things, and/or doing the same to others. You clearly think men are 'more perverted' because they have higher testosterone, and now you're becoming a 'proper lady' with your so-called sex reassignment. Bulls**t! Women are just as 'perverted' as men, and I know this from experience! The hormones don't make you female, since you have a body that is biologically MALE on every level. Regardless of what gender quacks who work for the biz say, no 'sex change' will ever make you a real female. The 'female hormones' do not have the same effect on a male brain and body as on a female.
